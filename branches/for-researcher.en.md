# Extension Path: For Researchers

> [繁體中文](./for-researcher.md) | [简体中文](./for-researcher.zh-Hans.md) | **English**

> 🚀 **Computational researchers** (can run Python scripts, have an API key, and can use git) can jump into the advanced path directly. **Non-programming researchers** (humanities/social sciences, clinical research, literature-first work) can start with literature Q&A (NotebookLM) and Zotero AI tools, then read [`resources/setup-guide.en.md` A-C](../resources/setup-guide.en.md) when needed.

> [← Back to main path README](../README.en.md) · Continue here after **Track A's A3** or **Track B's Stage 7**. Apply agentic AI to research workflows.

## Use Cases

Research days break into stages, and AI plays a different role at each stage. Use this table to orient yourself:

| Stage | Common pain point | How AI helps | Recommended tools (light to heavy) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Literature exploration** | You do not know the classic papers in a field | Recommendations + summaries + comparison | NotebookLM → paper-qa → gpt-researcher |
| **Close reading** | You lose the thread halfway through a PDF / miss the claim | Extract claims, figures, citations, and notes | Zotero + zotero-gpt → zotero-skills |
| **Research design** | The RQ is fuzzy, or the method choice is unclear | Clarifying dialogue and trade-off mapping | Claude.ai chat → ai-research-skills |
| **Experiments / coding** | Boilerplate repeats and plotting eats time | Write / edit code and batch refactor | Claude Code → codex-delegate |
| **Manuscript writing** | Drafts stall or sentences do not land | Outline → paragraphs → polishing | Claude.ai → gemini-delegate (long drafts) |
| **Revision / submission** | Journal requirements are easy to miss | banned-word / figure-text / submission checklist | academic-writing-skills |
| **Cross-paper synthesis** | Five papers need to talk to each other and context explodes | Read 1M tokens at once and organize the synthesis | gemini-delegate |

> 💡 **Computational vs non-programming researchers**: the recommended tools run from light to heavy. Non-programming researchers can usually stop at the **first** tool in each row; computational researchers should move right only when they need automation.

### Multi-LLM Research Stack (Maintainer Setup)

Some research tasks only need Claude (dialogue, design, review). Others waste Claude tokens (large code refactors, long-form drafts). The maintainer's actual setup is **Claude as planner / reviewer, Codex for code, and Gemini for long drafts**. Use this table to decide which model to use when:

| Task type | Example | LLM to use | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Research design / hypothesis discussion | "Should this RQ use logistic vs survival?" | Claude.ai chat | Collaborative dialogue and context memory |
| Writing / editing code | "Add logging to 50 simulation scripts" | codex-delegate | Fast mechanical edits without burning Claude tokens |
| Long-form drafting (Chinese / English) | "Draft an 8-page paper section" | gemini-delegate | 1M context and strong long-form prose |
| Second opinion | "Ask Gemini to review my discussion section" | gemini-delegate | LLM-vs-LLM comparison makes Claude's own biases easier to spot |
| Pre-submission audit | "Run banned-word + figure-text checklist" | academic-writing-skills | Structured audit instead of ad hoc LLM judgment |

#### Maintainer's 6 self-used research skills

> ⚠️ **Disclosure**: The following 6 tools are research skills used day to day by the maintainer [@WenyuChiou](https://github.com/WenyuChiou) (Lehigh CEE PhD candidate) and published for people with similar needs. **They have not been independently evaluated by third parties**. Best fit: PhD dissertation writing and cross-paper literature organization. They may not fit your field. Full entries are in [`resources/mcp-skills-catalog.en.md` 13 + 14](../resources/mcp-skills-catalog.en.md#13-research-workflow-skills-academic--paper--lit).

## Workflows to Master

The biggest mistake researchers make with AI is opening ChatGPT only when they get stuck. The key is making AI a daily tool by setting a cadence. The 7 workflows below are ordered by usage frequency and are routines the maintainer actually runs, not hypotheticals.

| Frequency | Workflow | How to run it (≤ 3 steps) | Recommended tools | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | Literature inbox triage | (1) Put yesterday's papers into paper-qa<br>(2) Extract claims + a 4-5 line summary<br>(3) Move notes into Zotero / Obsidian | paper-qa + zotero-gpt | All researchers |
| **Daily** | Writing sprint (25 min) | (1) Give one paragraph to Claude.ai<br>(2) Run banned-word + figure-text audit<br>(3) Merge the revision into the main draft | Claude.ai + academic-writing-skills | Paper-writing stage |
| **Weekly** | Cross-paper synthesis | (1) Feed 5-10 PDFs to Gemini<br>(2) Ask where the papers disagree<br>(3) Turn the answer into a 1-page brief | gemini-delegate (1M context) | Computational researchers |
| **Weekly** | Zotero cleanup | (1) Mark unread / read<br>(2) Retag items<br>(3) Pull out PDFs that should be archived | zotero-skills or zotero-gpt | All researchers |
| **Monthly** | Research progress brief | (1) Pull recent notes from Obsidian + Zotero + NotebookLM<br>(2) Summarize 5 progress points<br>(3) Send to your advisor | research-hub | People using all 3 tools |
| **Per paper** | Final pre-submission audit | (1) banned-word audit<br>(2) figure-text coupling check<br>(3) submission checklist | academic-writing-skills | Final week before submission |
| **Per paper** | Multi-agent peer review | (1) Claude reviews logic / argument<br>(2) Codex checks code / table numbers<br>(3) Gemini reviews prose / clarity | codex-delegate + gemini-delegate | Pre-submission second opinion |

> 💡 **Starter playbook**: run the daily inbox triage and writing sprint for one month first. Add advanced workflows only after the habit sticks.

## Tier Recommendations

Researchers do not need to install Claude Code on day one. This is the recommended progression:

| Tier | Tools | Best for | Learning cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 0** | Claude.ai web + NotebookLM | Non-programming researchers, humanities / social sciences, clinical research | 0 (browser skills are enough) |
| **Tier 1** | Claude Desktop + Zotero MCP / Obsidian MCP | Researchers already using Zotero / Obsidian | Half-day setup |
| **Tier 2** | Claude Code + ai-research-skills | Computational researchers who mostly write / edit code | 1-2 days to get started |
| **Tier 3** | Claude Code + codex-delegate + gemini-delegate + research-hub | People building a multi-LLM research pipeline across multiple tools | 1 week setup + ongoing tuning |

**Most researchers can stop at Tier 1-2**. Tier 3 is worth it only when you have a lot of repeated workflows, such as running the same paper synthesis every week.

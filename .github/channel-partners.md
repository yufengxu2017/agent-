| 5 | [hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code](outreach/awesome-claude-code.md) | GitHub **issue** | not contacted | — | — | — | ⚠️ Repo mid-reorg — open issue (not PR), park for new TOC |
| 6 | [punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers](outreach/awesome-mcp-servers.md) | GitHub PR | contacted | 2026-05-09 | — | — | [PR #6135](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/pull/6135). 2026-05-10: addressed bot name-check ([6f711ec](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/awesome-mcp-servers/commit/6f711ec3)) + replied to glama/emoji bot warnings ([comment](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers/pull/6135#issuecomment-4416517075)). Awaiting punkpeye human review. |

| 8 | [Moonshot Kimi](outreach/moonshot.md) | dev community / 知乎 | not contacted | — | — | — | Inviting them to PR a Kimi agent entry to §11 |
| 9 | [travisvn/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills) | GitHub PR | not contacted | — | — | — | ★12k, pushed 12d ago. Has explicit `## 📖 Tutorials & Guides` section — **perfect fit**. Use awesome-mcp-servers template, swap section name |
| 10 | [WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resources](https://github.com/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resources) | GitHub PR | not contacted | — | — | — | ★8k, Apache-2.0, pushed today. Has `## 智能体 Agents` + `## 研究 Research` sections. PR to 智能体 section makes sense |
| 11 | [AiHubCN/Awesome-Chinese-LLM](https://github.com/AiHubCN/Awesome-Chinese-LLM) | GitHub PR | not contacted | — | — | — | ★22k, pushed today, no license (yellow flag). Long TOC — need to browse README before deciding section. Lower priority due to license uncertainty |

## Sequencing rule

**Pace: 1-2 outbound sends per day.** Reasoning:

- Replies need to be handled. If we batch-send all 8 in one day, we can't respond
  to early-positive replies before they cool.
- Multiple open conversations dilute attention; one-at-a-time keeps quality.
- If 5 replies land in week 1, that's a good problem; if 0 land, we don't burn
  all our cards before learning what's not working.

Suggested first-week order (low-risk → high-risk, **revised 2026-05-09**
after upstream-target audit caught the awesome-claude-code reorg):

1. **Day 1**: [#6 punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers PR](outreach/awesome-mcp-servers.md)
   — has `## Tutorials` section, ★86k repo, reciprocal cite already exists.
   Lowest-risk concrete-action target.
2. **Day 2**: [#5 awesome-claude-code **issue**](outreach/awesome-claude-code.md)
   — repo mid-reorg, no PR-able sections; open an issue parking the proposal
   for when their new TOC lands.
3. **Day 3**: [#1 Datawhale](outreach/datawhale.md) — most strategic for zh-Hans
   reach (we cite Hello-Agents Extra05/08).
4. **Day 4**: [#2 liyupi](outreach/liyupi.md) — high reach if accepted (★13k
   resource hub).
5. **Day 5**: [#4 LangChain (kyrolabs/awesome-langchain)](outreach/langchain-ai.md).
6. **Day 6**: pause — review responses to date.
7. **Day 7+**: [#3 HuggingFace](outreach/huggingface-zh.md), then
   [#7 Zhipu](outreach/zhipu.md), [#8 Moonshot](outreach/moonshot.md) only
   after digesting earlier feedback.
8. **Day 8+ (added 2026-05-10 retroactively)**: targets 9-11 (`travisvn/awesome-claude-skills`,
   `WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resources`, `AiHubCN/Awesome-Chinese-LLM`) — discovered they were
   on `.github/launch-checklist.md` from day 1 but missing from this outreach matrix. Pitch
   files not yet drafted; use awesome-mcp-servers template as base when ready. Prioritize
   travisvn (cleanest fit, explicit Tutorials section).

## Update protocol

- Always update this matrix when contacted / received reply / closed.
- Use `git commit -m "outreach: status update for <target> (<status>)"` so the
  log is greppable.
- Dates: ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Notes: 1-2 lines max — full context lives in the per-target `outreach/<slug>.md`.

## What NOT to do

- ❌ Bulk-send same template to all 8 in one day — looks like spam
- ❌ Lead with star count (★525) — small to ★1k+ partners; lead with scope
- ❌ Promise things we won't ship (e.g., "we'll add X if you cross-link")
- ❌ Ping after one reply — give 5+ business days
- ❌ Pitch via Discord DM unless explicitly invited (follow each project's
  preferred contact channel; Discord DM cold = annoying)
- ❌ Edit pitch templates without recording the change in the file's git history

## Success indicators

Order by signal strength (top = stronger):

1. **Cross-link landed** in their canonical README / docs / awesome-list
2. **Public mention** (their tweet / post / blog cites us)
3. **Reciprocal listing** in their tutorials/learning section
4. **Soft acknowledgment** — they replied positively but no concrete action

If by **2026-06-01** no signal #1-3 has landed across all 8: pause outreach,
audit the pitch tone (likely too founder-y, not enough technical specifics).

# Exercise 1: Multi-Agent Debate

Pairs with [Stage 7 — Multi-Agent & Production](../../../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md) Exercise 1.

## Task

Three agents (PRO + CON + Judge) debate the same question:

```
            ┌────── PRO agent ──────┐
question ──>│                       ├──> Judge ──> WINNER
            └────── CON agent ──────┘
```

PRO and CON are called **independently** — they don't see each other's arguments (prevents bias propagation). The Judge sees both and decides.

## Why this pattern matters

- **Reduces single-LLM bias**: one LLM tends to bake in a stance and ignore counterarguments
- **Strengthens reasoning**: forcing both sides to articulate produces cleaner traces
- **Auditability**: high-stakes production decisions (policy / medical / legal review) need trails
- **Disagreement = signal**: when agents disagree, the question may be ambiguous or the model uncertain

## How to run

### Path A (default, free, local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
ollama serve
python starter.py
```

Budget: **$0**. Three LLM calls × CPU ≈ 15-45s.

### Path B (Anthropic)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python starter_anthropic.py
```

Budget: ~**$0.003** per run (3 calls × short prompts × claude-haiku-4-5).

## Validate the logic

```bash
python test.py             # 3 tests with mock LLM, verify judge sees pro+con
python test_anthropic.py
```

## Key design points

```python
# Same model, different system prompts
pro = llm_call(system="argue PRO position", user=question)
con = llm_call(system="argue CON position", user=question)

# Judge sees question + pro + con
judge = llm_call(
    system="neutral judge, output WINNER=PRO or WINNER=CON",
    user=f"Question: {question}\n\nPRO: {pro}\n\nCON: {con}",
)
```

**Key**: PRO and CON are **independent calls**. Don't pass PRO's output into CON — CON would then react to PRO rather than think independently, amplifying bias.

## Production variants

- **N-way debate**: 3+ agents holding different perspectives (e.g., "engineer / PM / customer view")
- **Iterative debate**: PRO and CON see each other and rebut for N rounds; first to concede loses
- **Different models**: PRO uses Claude, CON uses GPT, Judge uses Gemini — cross-model debate finds blind spots
- **Self-consistency**: run the debate 3 times, see how stable the Judge's verdict is

## Path observations

| Observation | Anthropic Claude | Ollama qwen2.5:3b |
|---|---|---|
| PRO / CON hold their positions | Stable | Sometimes both turn "balanced" — no clear stance |
| Judge outputs clear WINNER | Stable | Occasionally skips the `WINNER=` format |
| Reasoning quality | High | Medium |
| Cost | $0.003 | $0 |

## Common pitfalls

- **Identical system prompt for PRO and CON**: outputs converge, debate is meaningless
- **Fixed PRO-then-CON order in Judge prompt**: may bias toward whichever comes first (recency / primacy). Production should shuffle
- **No structured Judge output**: without `WINNER=PRO or CON` format, downstream parsing is painful
- **Prompts too short**: 1-sentence PRO and CON give the Judge nothing to weigh

## Extensions

- **Plug into [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)**: PRO/CON become parallel nodes, Judge a join
- **Use [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)**: AutoGen has first-class multi-agent debate support
- **Add confidence**: Judge outputs `confidence 0-1`; low confidence escalates to a human
- **Plug into eval (Exercise 2)**: run debate on 50 cases vs. single-agent baseline

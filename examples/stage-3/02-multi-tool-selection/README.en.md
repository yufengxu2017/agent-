# Exercise 2: Multi-Tool Selection

Corresponds to [Stage 3 — Tool Use & Agent Intro](../../../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md) Exercise 2.

## Why this matters

This exercise puts an LLM in front of three tools in a single turn: `web_search`, `calculator`, `calendar_lookup`. The point isn't tool quality — it's watching how schema `name` / `description` / `parameters` steer the model's choice. Writing schemas well is one of the highest-leverage things you do in Stage 3.

## How to run — two paths

### Path A (default, free, local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
ollama serve
python starter.py
```

Budget: **$0**. A single qwen2.5:3b tool call takes ~1-5s (CPU slower, GPU faster).

### Path B (Anthropic, cloud-quality comparison)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python starter_anthropic.py
```

Budget: ~**$0.0005** per run (claude-haiku-4-5).

Expected output (Path A, local):

```
❓ Question: What is (19 * 42) - 8? Use the best available tool. (using Ollama qwen2.5:3b)
   tool: calculator
   tool_input: {'expression': '(19 * 42) - 8'}
   observation: 790
✅ Exercise 2 passed — you ran multi-tool selection locally on qwen2.5:3b, $0/run
```

## Validate the logic without API credits (mock-based)

```bash
python test.py            # validates Path A (Ollama) starter.py logic
python test_anthropic.py  # validates Path B (Anthropic) starter_anthropic.py logic
```

Both test suites use `unittest.mock`, no real API call, $0/run. Path A uses the OpenAI-compat response shape; Path B uses Anthropic content blocks.

## SDK differences between the two paths

Three key differences (everything else is identical):

| Part | Anthropic (Path B) | OpenAI-compat / Ollama (Path A) |
|---|---|---|
| Schema wrap | `tools=[{name, description, input_schema}, ...]` | `tools=[{"type": "function", "function": {name, description, parameters}}, ...]` |
| Reading tool call | `resp.content[i].type == "tool_use"` | `resp.choices[0].message.tool_calls[i]` |
| input format | `call.input` is already a dict | `call.function.arguments` is a JSON string — needs `json.loads(...)` |

The selection **logic** is backend-agnostic — write a good schema and qwen2.5:3b picks the right tool too. This exercise is a great place to compare "on which questions does Claude pick the right tool but qwen2.5 doesn't?" — a clean way to feel the boundary of small models.

## Common pitfalls

The most common failure in multi-tool design is descriptions that read like documentation, not decision rules:

- `calendar_lookup` described as "calendar" is ambiguous with `web_search`; "look up events for a specific date" is clearer
- `web_search` is for "external / recent / uncertain info", `calculator` for arithmetic — the clearer the boundary, the fewer wrong picks
- Small models (qwen2.5:3b) are **more sensitive** to description quality than Claude — the same schema where Claude might guess correctly can lead qwen astray

## Want smarter answers?

Default is `claude-haiku-4-5` (cheapest). Try Sonnet:

```bash
MODEL=claude-sonnet-5 python starter_anthropic.py
```

Or on the Ollama path, swap to `qwen2.5:7b` (bigger, more stable, but slower):

```bash
MODEL=qwen2.5:7b python starter.py
```

## Extensions

- **Add more tools** — append one entry each to `TOOLS_SPEC` + `TOOL_IMPL`
- **Make it multi-turn ReAct** — wrap the single call in a `while` loop; see [`../03-react-from-scratch/`](../03-react-from-scratch/)
- **Dig into schema design** — see [`../06-schema-design/`](../06-schema-design/) for a bad vs good schema A/B

## 1. Basic concepts

### LLM (Large Language Model)

GPT, Claude, Gemini — models that take text in and produce text out. Fundamentally a pure function: input prompt → output text. **They don't browse the web, they don't remember past conversations** — those need to be wired up externally.

📍 Detail: [Stage 1](../stages/01-llm-basics.en.md)

### Token

LLMs see **tokens** (sub-word units), not characters. Roughly 1 English word ≈ 1.3 tokens, 1 Chinese character ≈ 1.5–2 tokens. LLM pricing and context windows are measured in tokens. "1M-token context" ≈ 750k English words.

📍 Detail: [Stage 1](../stages/01-llm-basics.en.md)

### Context Window

The maximum tokens an LLM can "see" in one call. **2026 frontier**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.8 1M, GPT-5.6 (preview) ~400k, Gemini 3.5 Flash 1M (Pro series up to 2M). **Bigger isn't always better** — beyond a length the LLM gets "Lost in the Middle".

### Prompt

The text you feed an LLM. **Prompt engineering** = designing that text to get good answers. Basic structure: system prompt (role/rules) + user prompt (the actual ask).

📍 Detail: [Stage 2](../stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md)

### Few-shot / Zero-shot

- **Zero-shot**: ask directly without examples.
- **Few-shot**: give 2–5 input → output examples first. **Few-shot usually improves accuracy a lot**, especially for strict formatting.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Make the LLM "think before answering" — have it output the reasoning process before the conclusion. **Two common forms**:

- **Few-shot CoT** ([Wei et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)): put a few examples with reasoning steps into the prompt, and the LLM imitates that style of thinking
- **Zero-shot CoT** ([Kojima et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)): add "Let's think step by step" at the end of the prompt to trigger a reasoning trace

**Accuracy usually improves**, at the cost of more tokens. Few-shot usually beats zero-shot.

---

## 2. Agents / Tool Use

### Agent

A system centered on an LLM that can **perceive state → make decisions → take actions → observe results** in a **loop**, repeating until the goal is completed. **Three core elements**:

- **LLM** (reasoning / planning / deciding)
- **Actions** (ways to do things — not limited to function calls. This can include writing and running code (CodeAct), operating a browser (computer use), retrieving from a KB (RAG retrieval), calling an MCP server, or pure planning / task decomposition)
- **Loop** (the heartbeat — the fundamental difference between an agent and plain LLM Q&A)

The difference is this: plain LLM = Q&A; agent = the three elements + a continuing loop until the goal is reached or the budget runs out. **ReAct is one agent pattern, not the definition of an agent** — CodeAct, computer-use, and planning agents are all agents.

📍 Detail: [Stage 3](../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md)

### Tool Use / Function Calling

Lets the LLM call functions you defined (DB lookup, math, browser, …). Instead of plain text, the LLM returns `{"function": "search", "args": {…}}`. Your code executes it and feeds the result back to the LLM.

**The concept is the same; the API schema differs**:
- **Anthropic "Tool Use"**: uses `input_schema` (JSON Schema directly)
- **OpenAI / Ollama "Function Calling"**: wraps it in an outer `{"type": "function", "function": {...}}`
- The token representation the LLM sees differs internally, so when writing a cross-vendor SDK you need to map them correctly

📍 Detail: [Stage 3](../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md)
📍 How to write good schemas: [Function Schema Design cheatsheet](schema-design-cheatsheet.en.md)

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The classic agent pattern: **Thought → Action (call tool) → Observation (see result) → Thought ...** loop until done. Most agent frameworks implement this internally.

📍 Detail: [Stage 3](../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md)

### Structured Output

Make the LLM output **JSON or another fixed schema** instead of free text. All major LLM APIs have `response_format` or similar. Agent frameworks rely on it for LLM ↔ code communication.

### Agent Loop

The "LLM → tool → result → LLM" repeated cycle. Termination: LLM says "done" / step budget exhausted / cost cap hit.

### Self-Refine (Basic reflection / no memory)

The agent evaluates the previous round's output and changes the next round's behavior — an "Actor answers → Critic finds issues → Actor reads feedback and answers again" single-session loop. **It does not need a persistent memory layer**; it is purely a reasoning-loop mechanism, a sibling pattern to ReAct. Production agents (Cursor / Cline / Claude Code) run variants of this every day.

Representative paper: [Self-Refine (Madaan 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651). **For the full Reflexion version** (with episodic memory), see 3 Memory / Retrieval / RAG.

📍 Detail + routing: [Stage 3 Reflection](../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md#-reflection-reflexion--self-refine--concept--routing)

---

## 3. Memory / Retrieval / RAG

### Memory — Two Orthogonal Axes

"Memory" often gets lumped together, but there are actually **2 orthogonal classification axes**:

- **Time axis**: short-term (current conversation) vs long-term (persistent across sessions)
- **Content axis** (CoALA framework): **Working** (scratch space) / **Episodic** (past experiences) / **Semantic** (factual knowledge) / **Procedural** (how to do things)

→ The two axes do not conflict: long-term memory can contain **at the same time** episodic memory (what the user said last time), semantic memory (facts from the company's knowledge base), and procedural memory (tool sequences that worked before).

📍 Detail: [Stage 6 What is Memory + How to Design It](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md#-what-is-memory--how-to-design-it) + [Stage 6 CoALA Framework](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md#advanced-coala-framework--a-4-layer-taxonomy-for-agent-memory)

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Two-stage architectural pattern:

1. **Ingest** (one-time / periodic): document → chunk → embed → store in a vector store (build a retrievable KB)
2. **Query** (every user question): embed the question → semantic search (or hybrid + BM25) → top-K chunks → put them into the prompt → LLM answers

**Solves the problem that the LLM does not know your private / changing / stale data**. Retrieval is **not limited to dense embeddings** — the production default is hybrid (dense + BM25) + reranker.

📍 Detail: [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md)
📍 Paper: [Lewis et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)

### Reflexion (Full reflection / with episodic memory)

Unlike Self-Refine (2 Agents), Reflexion **requires a persistent episodic memory store** — after each trial, the agent **writes a reflection summary into memory**, then retrieves it into the prompt at the start of the next trial. **Accumulating lessons across trials** is the essence of Reflexion (not a single-session loop).

It is placed in 3 instead of 2 because it is **fundamentally a memory pattern** — the episodic memory store is core, not optional.

Representative paper: [Reflexion (Shinn 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366).

📍 Detail: [Stage 6 Advanced: Full Reflexion with Persistent Memory](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md#-advanced-full-reflexion-with-persistent-memory--track-b-elective)

### Embedding

Turn text / images into N-dimensional **vectors** so that things with similar meanings are close together. This roadmap defaults to **dense embeddings** (dense vectors produced by sentence-transformers / OpenAI ada-002, etc.); there are also **sparse embeddings** (BM25 / SPLADE, etc., based on lexical token matching) — production RAG often uses both together for hybrid search.

📍 Detail: [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md)

### Vector DB

The storage layer for storing + efficiently querying embeddings. **The main query type = approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN)** — the whole point of a vector DB is that ANN is hundreds of times faster than brute-force cosine scanning. Examples: Pinecone / Chroma / Qdrant / Weaviate / pgvector.

📍 Detail: [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md)

### Semantic Search

Use embeddings to compare "meaning similarity" rather than "exact string match". "How do I charge an EV" can retrieve "electric car battery tutorial". Traditional keyword search (BM25, etc.) can't do this.

### Chunking

Splitting long documents into embedding-friendly small pieces (typically 200–1000 tokens). **Chunk strategy directly affects RAG quality** — too small loses context, too long blurs relevance. Common: fixed-size, by paragraph, by structure (heading-based).

### Hybrid Search

Run semantic search and keyword search together, merge and rerank. Usually beats either alone. Production-grade RAG default.

### Reranking

After first-pass retrieval pulls top-50, use a more expensive but more accurate model (cross-encoder) to rerank to top-5 for the LLM. Cohere Rerank, bge-reranker, etc.

### Contextual Retrieval

Anthropic 2024 method — embed each chunk together with a summary of the document it came from, so "this chunk taken alone makes no sense" doesn't break retrieval.

📍 Detail: [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md)

### Fine-tuning

Re-train the model on your own data, baking knowledge or behavior into the weights (unlike RAG — RAG injects data into the context at inference time and never changes the weights). Good for making the model reliably learn a **format / style / domain vocabulary**; **not** for stuffing in "the latest facts" (that is RAG's job — facts fine-tuned in go stale and are hard to update). In most agent scenarios, **try prompt + RAG first**, and only consider fine-tuning if that genuinely is not enough.

📍 Detail: [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md)

---

## 4. Multi-Agent

### Multi-Agent

Multiple agents collaborating on one task. Common patterns:

- **Supervisor + Worker**: one agent plans/dispatches, others execute.
- **Swarm**: peer agents, no fixed supervisor.
- **Debate**: agents argue different positions, then form consensus.

📍 Detail: [Stage 7](../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md)

### Handoff

One agent transfers a task to another. Adds "how to pass context" and "who handles failure" beyond a plain function call.

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol

Google's protocol for agent ↔ agent communication. Sibling to MCP, but for agent-to-agent rather than agent-to-tool.

---

## 5. Claude Code Ecosystem

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Anthropic's open protocol, introduced in 2024, that lets any LLM host (Claude Code, Cursor, your own agent) connect to external tool servers through one interface. Think "**USB for LLMs**".

**Technically it standardizes 3 primitives**:
- **Tools**: functions an LLM can call (read DB / search web / send email…)
- **Resources**: data an LLM can read (file contents, API responses, DB rows…)
- **Prompts**: reusable prompt templates (triggered inside the host with `/`)

**Architecture**: server / client pattern — the tool server runs locally or remotely, and the LLM host connects as the client. The server exposes those primitives over one of three transports: stdio / SSE / HTTP.

📍 Detail: [Stage 5.2](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#52--mcp-model-context-protocol--foundation)

### Skills / SKILL.md

Claude Code's "behavior bundles". A Skill = a folder containing `SKILL.md` (describing "what to do in what situations, and which tools can be called") + optional reference files / scripts.

**Trigger mechanism** (many people do not know this, but it matters): before Claude Code handles each message, it scans the **frontmatter `description` field** of every available skill — if it matches the current situation, the corresponding SKILL.md is auto-loaded. **So the quality of the description directly determines whether the skill gets triggered.** In practice, starting with "Use when ..." works best.

📍 Detail: [Stage 5.3](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#53--skills-claude-codes-behavior-layer--the-most-critical-layer-of-the-claude-code-ecosystem)

### Plugin / Marketplace

Package multiple Skills + slash commands + hooks + MCP configs into one shippable unit. A **Marketplace** is a catalog of plugins; users `claude plugin install` to grab community-built ones.

📍 Detail: [Stage 5.4](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#54--plugins--marketplaces)

### Slash Command

Commands inside Claude Code starting with `/` (`/help`, `/compact`, `/plan`, etc.). Custom-definable — drop a prompt into `.claude/commands/<name>.md` and it becomes `/name`.

### CLAUDE.md

A markdown file at project root that Claude Code reads on every launch. Project-level rules / conventions / context (language, code style, files to avoid, etc.).

### Hooks

Scripts that run before or after specific Claude Code events. **The official system supports 7 event types**:

| Hook | Trigger time | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | **Before** a tool call | Block dangerous operations (`rm -rf`, destructive ops), rewrite parameters |
| `PostToolUse` | **After** a tool call | Logging, auto-format files that were just written |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | When the user submits a message | Add context (git status / current time) |
| `Notification` | When Claude Code emits a notification | Desktop toast / Slack ping |
| `Stop` | When the session ends | Auto-commit / cleanup |
| `PreCompact` | Before auto-compact | Promote important decisions into memory |
| `PostCompact` | After compact | Check what context got compressed |

Configuration: add a `"hooks"` block in `.claude/settings.json` and point it at your script path.

### Subagent

A spawned agent from the main Claude Code session, with its own context window, dedicated to a specific task. E.g. "spin up a code-reviewer subagent for this diff."

How to set up: put frontmatter + system prompt + tool whitelist in `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. The main session invokes it with the Task tool (automatic parallel / sequential). **Compared with framework-based multi-agent**: a subagent does not require LangGraph / CrewAI or similar frameworks; markdown is enough, but it is tied to the Claude Code runtime. Full guide: [Stage 5.5](../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature); **15 copy-paste dispatch recipes** → [`subagent-cookbook.en.md`](./subagent-cookbook.en.md).

---

## 6. Production / Eval / Cost

### Eval (Evaluation Framework)

Run a test set against your agent and quantify accuracy / latency / cost. **A production agent without eval has no tests.** Common: promptfoo, LangSmith, langfuse evals.

📍 Detail: [Stage 7](../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md)

### Observability

Capture every internal step (which LLM call, which tool, what result). Lets you replay when bugs hit. Common: langfuse, Helicone, weave.

📍 Detail: [Stage 7](../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md)

### Prompt Caching

LLM caches the prefix of a prompt; on repeat, only the new suffix is billed at full price (Anthropic 90% off cached, OpenAI 50% off). Long-context repeated queries save a lot.

### Streaming

LLM returns tokens as they're generated (one at a time) instead of waiting for the full response. Better UX (looks like typing); technically uses SSE or chunked transfer. **Default for production interactive apps**. Trade-offs: client must handle partial responses; ReAct tool-call parsing waits for stream end.

### Batch API

Bundle a large number of LLM requests for delayed (≤24h) processing. **Typically 50% off (Anthropic, OpenAI)**. Good for non-interactive: batch summarization, batch classification, eval suites, ETL pipelines. **Don't use for interactive chat** — latency unacceptable.

### Token Cost / Inference Cost

Per LLM call: input tokens × input price + output tokens × output price. Costs of an agent's ReAct loop add up fast — a single grep over a large codebase can run 100k tokens.

### Guardrails

Rule layer that prevents the LLM from doing bad things — block prompt injection, PII leakage, harmful output, etc. NeMo Guardrails, Guardrails AI, etc.

### Prompt Injection

Hiding malicious instructions inside content the LLM will read (web pages, documents, tool results) so it ignores its real task and does what the attacker wants. Root cause: the LLM can't tell "instructions" apart from "instructions smuggled inside data". Defenses: least privilege, isolating untrusted content, human review of high-risk actions. Related: lethal trifecta, Guardrails.

### Lethal Trifecta

Simon Willison's framing: an agent becomes exploitable when it has all three of (1) access to private data, (2) exposure to untrusted content, (3) the ability to communicate externally — at which point prompt injection can make it steal and exfiltrate data. The defense is to break at least one leg (commonly: cut external comms, or isolate untrusted input).

---

## 7. Buzzwords / Loose Terms

### CLI Agent

Agents that run in a terminal (Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Gemini CLI, etc.). Versus IDE-bound (Cursor, Continue) or web-based (ChatGPT, Claude.ai).

📍 Detail: [Track A A1](../tracks/cli/A1-cli-intro.en.md), [`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`](cli-agents-guide.en.md)

### BYO API Key (Bring Your Own)

Tool that supports user-provided API keys instead of bundled subscriptions. Aider / OpenCode / goose are BYO; Claude Code / Codex default to subscriptions.

### Local LLM / On-Device

Models running on your own hardware (Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX, LocalAI, etc.). Data stays local — privacy-friendly but capabilities lag frontier models.

📍 Detail: [Stage 1](../stages/01-llm-basics.en.md)

### Quantization

Compress model weights from fp16 down to int8 / int4 to save memory and increase speed at small accuracy cost. Local LLM users see this constantly (Q4_K_M, Q8_0, etc.).

### Hallucination

The LLM "confidently asserts something false" — invents APIs, fabricates numbers and presents them as fact. Every production agent needs defenses (RAG / structured output / eval / guardrails).

### Frontier Model

The current top tier (**2026-06 (late)**: OpenAI GPT-5.6 (Sol / Terra / Luna, preview), Google Gemini 3.5 Flash, xAI Grok 4.3, Mistral Medium 3.5 (open weights, preview); **2026-06 (early)**: Claude Fable 5 (Mythos-class, above Opus) briefly shipped, but ⚠️ **a US export-control directive suspended all access on 2026-06-12 ([status](https://status.claude.com/) · [statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access)); Fable 5 and Mythos 5 are currently unavailable**; **2026-05**: GPT-5.5, Claude Opus 4.8 (Opus-class flagship and the current top usable Claude tier), Gemini 3.1 Pro, DeepSeek-V4-Pro, etc.). Use frontier for hard reasoning; use cheap small models for simple classification / translation to save cost.

### Context Engineering

The discipline of engineering **what information goes into the context window on each LLM call** — dynamically assembling RAG retrieval results, memory, tool definitions, and conversation history into the context the model can see. Karpathy 2025: the delicate art of putting **just the right information for the next step** into the window. The key question is *what goes in the window*, not "how many calls are involved." **The next layer above prompt engineering** — prompt engineering shapes **strings**; context engineering shapes **information**.

📍 Detail: [Stage 2 closing](../stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md) / [Stage 6](../stages/06-memory-rag.en.md) / [Stage 7](../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md)
📍 Further: [`Meirtz/Awesome-Context-Engineering`](https://github.com/Meirtz/Awesome-Context-Engineering)

### Harness Engineering

The discipline of engineering the **execution and control layer around the model** — everything that is not model weights and not just the prompt string itself: agent loop / tool registry / context manager / permissions / safety layer / memory layer / eval / observability / retry / circuit breaker, etc. Simon Willison 2025: **coding agent = LLM + harness**. Addy Osmani: harness = all the code that is not the model itself. [OpenAI also used the term "Harness Engineering" in February 2026](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering). Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, etc. are harnesses. **A framework wraps an LLM into an agent; a harness wraps an agent into a product that can actually go live.**

Contrast:
- **Framework** (Stage 4) defines the **API**: what the interface you call looks like
- **Harness** (this term) defines the **runtime**: how it runs, how it recovers, how it is observed

### Loop Engineering

The fourth discipline after prompt → context → harness engineering: designing and tuning an agent's iteration loop itself (goal, tools, context management, termination logic, error handling) so long-running, multi-step, cross-session execution stays reliable and on-target. Related: harness, Dynamic Workflows, ReAct.

## 8. Agent Interfaces

### Computer Use (screen-level agent)

An agent operates real desktop apps via **screenshot → vision → coordinates → simulated mouse/keyboard** — no API needed, the agent uses the screen like a human. Representative: Anthropic Claude Computer Use (Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 4.6), OpenAI Codex desktop, Google Gemini in Chrome. **Anthropic public beta opened Oct 2024; OSWorld benchmark reached 76.26% (superhuman) by May 2026**.

📍 Full coverage + 4-vendor comparison: [Stage 8 Computer Use](../stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md)

### Browser Use (web-level agent)

An agent operates web pages, primarily via **DOM-aware navigation** (direct CSS selector queries) with vision fallback. Closed-source: Atlas / Comet / Dia / Gemini in Chrome. OSS leader: [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) (★ 95k+).

📍 Full coverage + 5-vendor comparison + OSS frameworks: [Stage 8 Browser Use](../stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md)

### Sandbox (code execution isolation)

Runs agent-written code in an isolated environment instead of the host — avoids `rm -rf /`, internet data exfiltration, credential theft. Representatives: E2B (Firecracker microVM), Daytona (container), Modal (GPU sandbox), Vercel, Cloudflare. **OpenAI Agents SDK natively supports these as of April 2026**.

📍 Full 9-row terminology glossary + 7-vendor comparison: [Stage 8 Code Sandbox](../stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md)

### microVM (micro Virtual Machine)

A slimmed-down VM with minimal footprint, < 100ms startup, yet still has an **independent kernel** — sits between Docker containers (fast + weak isolation) and full VMs (slow + strong isolation). **Most agent sandboxes choose microVM**. Implementation example: Firecracker (AWS, used by E2B).

📍 Full comparison: [Stage 8 terminology glossary](../stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md)

### Firecracker

AWS's open-source microVM, written in Rust, **the underlying technology of AWS Lambda** and E2B sandbox isolation. Provides strong isolation + fast startup.

### gVisor

Google's "user-space kernel" — intercepts syscalls and emulates them itself, no hypervisor required. Sits between containers and VMs.

After your CLI runs smoothly, the next step is to **wire the CLI into your real team workflow**. This stop does 3 things:

1. **Tool connection** — MCP servers connect the CLI to Slack / Gmail / your internal API
2. **Automated checks** — CI (GitHub Actions) runs CLI review on every PR
3. **Cost and logs** — observability tools track cost / latency for each task

After this stop, the CLI is no longer just your personal tool — it's part of your team's workflow.

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Connect 1-3 MCP servers to your CLI (Slack / Gmail / internal API / DB)
- Set up GitHub Actions to auto-run Claude Code (PR review, release notes, etc.)
- Add observability (trace, cost, latency) to CLI workflows
- Plan a cost budget — know roughly what a big task costs in tokens

## 📚 Required Reading

1. [**Stage 5.2 — MCP (Model Context Protocol)**](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#52--mcp-model-context-protocol--foundation) — MCP concept and basics
2. [**Anthropic — Prompt Caching**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching) — can significantly reduce repeated context cost under cache-eligible conditions (unchanged context, ≤5-minute reuse window, etc.); actual savings depend on the workflow, so use the official article's conditions as the reference
3. [**Stage 7 — Observability section**](../../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md#exercise-3-observability) — langfuse / Helicone / weave
4. [**`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`** "Common pitfalls"](../../resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md) — most common production issues with CLIs

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise CLI-9: MCP server connected to CLI
Following [Stage 5.2 Exercise: MCP client](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#hands-on-exercises), connect at least one useful MCP server to your CLI:
- `filesystem` server → let the CLI read files outside its default scope
- `github` server → let it read PRs / issues directly
- Custom server → connect your internal API / DB

Success: in a CLI conversation, ask "does my PR have conflicts?" and have the CLI answer via MCP (without you opening a browser).

### Exercise CLI-10: GitHub Actions + CLI
Write `.github/workflows/cli-review.yml`:
- Trigger: PR opened / synchronize
- Run: in the GH Actions runner, execute Claude Code (or Codex), feed it `git diff` + your `.claude/commands/review.md`
- Output: PR comment

Success: open a new PR, see a review comment within 1-2 minutes.

> Starting points: Anthropic's official [`claude-code-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action); Codex has GitHub App and CLI modes.

### Exercise CLI-11: Cost tracking
Run a daily task. **Predict** the token usage first, then actually run it and check the usage. The gap is usually big (you typically underestimate).
- Math: input tokens + output tokens × model price each
- Connect langfuse or Helicone ([Stage 7 Observability](../../stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md#exercise-3-observability)) for tracing
- Observe: which sub-task consumes the most tokens? Are you sending unnecessary long context?

### Exercise CLI-12: Skill / plugin team sharing
Package your `.claude/commands/` and `CLAUDE.md` into a plugin, publish to internal marketplace or GitHub. Teammates `claude plugin install` and get the same workflow.
- Skill / plugin details in [Stage 5.3 + 5.4](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md)

## 🧭 Advanced Concepts in Daily CLI Work (7 Playbooks) 🆕

Track A users are **already using** [Stage 7.5 advanced concepts](../../stages/07.5-advanced-agentic-concepts.en.md) — they just have not named them yet. Pick the **2-3 playbooks you use most often** and treat the rest as further reading — each in ≤ 6 lines. **Want the deeper theory → go to Stage 7.5.**

> 📌 **Rule**: after each playbook, ask yourself "will I do something differently in the next PR?" **Yes** → applied; **No** → skip to the next one.

### 📋 Playbook 1: Scope unclear, agent overreaches

- **When**: You send Codex/Gemini on a sweep and are not sure whether it will silently touch unrelated files (the F11/F12 kind of failure)
- **Do**: At the top of the brief, state "change X / do not cross Y" explicitly; add a path filter to the acceptance preset
- **Concepts**: Work Boundary + Hierarchical Task Decomposition · 📊 See [concept-cluster](../../resources/diagrams/concept-cluster.en.png), Service × orchestration cluster

### 📋 Playbook 2: Multi-agent parallel runs, results conflict

- **When**: Claude planner + 2-3 Codex agents run in parallel and the merge ends up with conflicts / drift
- **Do**: Give each agent its own commit; use a reviewer pattern to catch drift (not one giant merge); standardize the brief format + `result.json` schema
- **Concepts**: Contract Hand-offs + Speculative Parallel · 📊 See [concept-cluster](../../resources/diagrams/concept-cluster.en.png), Service × orchestration + Types × orchestration

### 📋 Playbook 3: Reviewing agent output

- **When**: An agent finished the PR, you do not want to merge it blindly, and human review cannot keep up with the throughput
- **Do**: Add an LLM-as-judge subagent for automatic evaluation (binary pass/fail); humans only spot-check edge cases; run the acceptance-gate preset before commit
- **Concepts**: Agent-as-Judge + Plan-Act-Reflect · 📊 See [reading-decision-tree](../../resources/diagrams/reading-decision-tree.en.png), blue eval branch

### 📋 Playbook 4: Dispatching subagents for independent tasks

> 💡 **First time hearing about subagents?** In one sentence: **a subagent is a “child Claude” spawned from the main Claude session**. It has its own isolated context and reports back when done. **Dispatch** means asking the subagent to do work, like assigning a task to a teammate. Full concept → [Stage 5.5](../../stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature).

- **When**: before committing a large change / entering an unfamiliar repo / running an LLM-as-judge auto-eval / applying the same review to 4 targets
- **Do**: invoke Claude Code **built-in** subagents (no custom file required):
  - `code-reviewer` — review staged diff, find bugs + security issues
  - `Explore` — read-only codebase search, find entry points / symbols
  - `Plan` — design a step-by-step implementation plan
  - `general-purpose` — fallback when you are unsure which one to use, or for multi-step research
- **Concepts**: Hierarchical Task Decomposition + Context Isolation · 📊 See [concept-cluster](../../resources/diagrams/concept-cluster.en.png), Service × orchestration cluster

  - [`resources/subagent-cookbook.en.md`](../../resources/subagent-cookbook.en.md) (**15 recipes** with copy-paste prompt templates)

---

### 📋 Playbook 5: Running CLI agent in CI

- **When**: You wire `codex exec` / `claude --print` into GitHub Actions, cannot require a human to hit yes every time, and bandwidth constraints mean you cannot always use Opus
- **Do**: Use layered autonomy (preset auto-runs / commit requires review / push requires human sign-off); set a fallback cheaper model (if Opus is down, fall back to Haiku)
- **Concepts**: Autonomy Gradients + Graceful Degradation · 📊 See [concept-cluster](../../resources/diagrams/concept-cluster.en.png), Config × governance cluster

### 📋 Playbook 6: Controlling cost

- **When**: You use Codex for a large batch of work, the monthly API bill is getting out of control, and you want to stay inside budget
- **Do**: Set `max_cost_usd` in `plan.yml`; use a cheap model (Haiku) for exploration and an expensive model (Opus) only for polish; turn on prompt caching (can significantly reduce repeated context cost under cache-eligible conditions); automate QA instead of spending human time

### 📋 Playbook 7: Hardening workflow, preventing drift

- **When**: You wrote rules in `CLAUDE.md` / `SKILL.md` but nobody enforces them, or you added a preset YAML and do not know whether it actually works
- **Do**: Intentionally break one rule and run the acceptance gate to see whether it catches it (chaos test); treat `docs/` as the single source of truth and keep `CLAUDE.md` as an entry map only
- **Concepts**: Failure Injection + System of Record · 📊 See [failure-lifecycle](../../resources/diagrams/failure-lifecycle.en.png) (the F11-F14 evolution loop)

## ✅ Track A Full Self-Check

Can you:
- [ ] Have at least 1 MCP server connected to your daily CLI
- [ ] Have at least 1 CI workflow auto-running a CLI agent
- [ ] State the rough token / cost / latency for some specific task you run
- [ ] Packaged your CLAUDE.md / commands at least once (even just for yourself)
- [ ] Know which tasks deserve observability and which don't

If yes → **Track A complete**. We recommend continuing to [**Stage 8 — Agent Interfaces**](../../stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md) (**a shared hub for both tracks**: Computer Use / Browser Use / Code Sandbox, ~1-2 weeks from the Track A angle), or pick a [specialized branch](../../README.en.md#️-learning-map-two-tracks) and continue (researcher / developer / teacher / knowledge-worker / everyday-users).

If you want to go deeper into "**how to write your own CLI agent**" (not use existing) → jump to [Track B Stage 3](../../stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md). Track A and Track B are complementary.

## 💡 What's Next

After Track A you're a CLI power user. Next phase choices:

1. **Deepen CLI workflow** (keep refining your setup)
   - Subscribe to Anthropic / OpenAI changelogs
   - Quarterly review of [`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`](../../resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md) for new tools
   - Share CLAUDE.md / skills with your team

2. **Cross to Track B** (learn to write your own agent)
   - Stage 3-4: tool use + frameworks
   - Stage 5: deep dive into Claude Code internals
   - Stage 7: write your own multi-agent system

3. **Walk a specialized branch** (apply CLI to a specific domain)
   - Researcher / developer / knowledge-worker / teacher / everyday-users
   - Each branch uses what you learned in Track A

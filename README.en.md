> **Trilingual — the English edition is fully maintained, not a thin machine translation** (only ~0.4% of English lines carry any CJK, almost all intentional bilingual term-mapping). zh-TW is the curation source of truth (new content lands there first); the English and 简中 editions track the same structure, with CI checking localization correctness and anchor integrity across all three.

**Learning roadmap + 240+ curated resources + simple illustrative cases** — three pillars helping you go from "I don't know where to start" to "I can design multi-agent systems". Structured **8-stage** path from LLM fundamentals to multi-agent orchestration, Computer Use / Browser Use / Code Sandbox.

## 🎯 Why this exists

**What this repo is**: **a learning roadmap + 240+ curated resources + simple illustrative cases** — three pillars helping AI / AI-agent learners go from "I don't know where to start" to "I can design multi-agent systems."

Concretely:

| Pillar | What it does | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| **Learning roadmap** | Organizes scattered high-quality projects, tutorials, and required reading into **8 stages** (including Stage 5 + Stage 8 as two shared hubs) + 2 tracks + 5 specialized branches, from zero to advanced | 8 stages, 2 tracks |
| **Resource curation** | Each stage curates **240+** projects (star rating, audience, what they teach, how to run) plus an MCP/Skill catalog covering the Chinese AI ecosystem (DeepSeek, Zhipu, Kimi, …) | 240+ projects, 65 MCP/Skill |
| **Simple illustrative cases** | Each stage ships 1-5 **foundational exercises** (70-150 line starter + dual-path Ollama/Anthropic SDK comparison + mock-based tests) | 23 exercise folders |

After the main path, you go from "**LLM user**" to "**agent system builder**" — capable of designing multi-agent collaboration, writing your own MCP server, and shipping real agent systems.

## 🗺️ Learning Map (Two Tracks)

![AI Agent Learning Map](resources/diagrams/learning-map.en.png)

After **Stages 0-2 (shared foundations)**, pick a track based on your goal:

- **Track A — CLI Power User**: you want to **USE** existing CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, etc.) to get work done — not build agents from scratch. 3 sub-stages (A1-A3).
- **Track B — Agent Builder**: you want to **BUILD** your own agents — learn frameworks, write ReAct, design multi-agent systems. Stages 3-8 main path.

The two tracks are **not mutually exclusive** — most people start with A to get hands-on, then come back to B for internals (or vice versa). Stage 5 (Claude Code Ecosystem) is used by both tracks.

### Shared Foundations (Stages 0-2)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | [Foundations](stages/00-foundations.en.md) | Python · CLI · git · API · JSON | 1-2 wks |
| **1** | [LLM Fundamentals](stages/01-llm-basics.en.md) | tokens · API · model comparison · local LLM | 1 wk |
| **2** | [Prompt Engineering](stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md) | system prompts · few-shot · CoT | 1-2 wks |

### Track A — CLI Power User (use CLIs to get work done)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |

| **+5** | [Stage 5 — Claude Code Ecosystem](stages/05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md) (**Shared Hub**) | MCP · Skills · Plugins · Subagents; Track A reads 5.1-5.4 (5.5-5.7 optional) | 1-2 wks (Track A view) |
| **+8** | [Stage 8 — Agent Interfaces](stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md) (**Shared Hub**) | Computer Use · Browser Use · Code Sandbox; Track A reads Track A usage | 1-2 wks (Track A view) |

> **Track A total time**: includes Stages 0-2 (shared foundations) + A1-A3 + **Stage 5 + Stage 8 (two shared hubs) ≈ 8-10 weeks**. Core reference: [`resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md`](resources/cli-agents-guide.en.md).

### Track B — Agent Builder (build agents from scratch)

| Stage | Topic | Key Content | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **3** ⭐ | [Tool Use & Hello Agent](stages/03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md) | function calling · ReAct · 5 hands-on exercises | 2-3 wks |

| **8** ⭐⭐ | [Agent Interfaces](stages/08-agent-interfaces.en.md) (**Shared Hub**, Track A also studies) | Computer Use · Browser Use · Code Sandbox; 2024-2026 frontier | 2-3 wks (Track B view) |

> **Track B total time**: minimum **16-22 weeks**, realistic **5-7 months** (5-8 hr/week part-time)

> **Two shared hubs (used by both Track A + Track B)**:
> - **Stage 5** = Claude Code Ecosystem (MCP / Skills / Plugins / Subagents) — Track A learns MCP-into-CLI, Track B learns agent runtime structure
> - **Stage 8** = Agent Interfaces (Computer Use / Browser / Sandbox, 2024-2026 frontier) — Track A learns "how to use" for task delegation, Track B learns "how to build" with embedded interfaces

After the main path, pick one of 5 specialized branches. **Not sure which?**

![Branch decision tree](resources/diagrams/branch-decision-tree.en.png)

> 💡 **The Everyday User branch can be read directly without walking the main path** — it's for people who want to use AI without writing code.

| Branch | Best for | Topics |
|---|---|---|
| 🔬 [Researcher](branches/for-researcher.en.md) | Grad students, postdocs, PIs | Lit triage · paper writing · multi-agent review |
| 💻 [Developer](branches/for-developer.en.md) | Software engineers | Cursor · Aider · CLI delegation · code review |
| 🎓 [Teacher](branches/for-teacher.en.md) | Teachers, instructors | Lesson planning · slides · student feedback · privacy / ethics · prompt templates |

## 💡 How to Learn

Welcome — future agent system builder. Some guidance before you start.

This roadmap balances concepts with hands-on work, helping you **transform from an LLM user into an agent system builder**. It assumes **basic Python**. Before starting:

- **Basic Python** — written functions, used APIs, can read JSON
- **Basic git** — clone, commit, push
- **Motivation to learn** — agents are the fastest-changing area in AI 2025+, and require sustained effort

If anything's missing, do Stage 0; if not, **start at Stage 1**.

The main path has 5 parts:

- **Part 1 (Stages 0-2): Foundations & LLM Basics** — Python / git / API, what's an LLM, prompt design
- **Part 2 (Stages 3-4): Build Your Agent** — from tool use to agents, learn the major frameworks
- **Part 3 (Stage 5) Shared Hub** — Claude Code Ecosystem (MCP / Skills / Plugins / Subagents; used by both Track A + B)
- **Part 4 (Stages 6-7): Advanced Integration** — memory / RAG / multi-agent collaboration / harness engineering
- **Part 5 (Stage 8) Shared Hub** — Agent Interfaces (Computer Use / Browser Use / Code Sandbox, 2024-2026 frontier; used by both tracks)

> 🔭 **Three layers of concept evolution**: **prompt engineering** (Stage 2 — how to write a single prompt) → **context engineering** (Stage 3 onward — how to dynamically assemble system prompt + memory + retrieved chunks + tool schema) → **harness engineering** (Stage 7 — agent loop / eval / observability / deploy as a complete production system). Three terms, three phases; you don't need to look elsewhere. See [`stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md`](stages/02-prompt-engineering.en.md) "Beyond prompts: context engineering" and [`stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md`](stages/07-multi-agent-production.en.md) Required Reading 5+6.

After the main path (16-22 weeks for Track B, 8-10 weeks for Track A), pick a branch.

The most important advice: **don't skip the hands-on exercises**. Each stage's exercises are "you can't learn this without doing it" — skim past them and you'll get stuck later.

> 🎓 **How to actually use the exercises**: the `starter.py` in each exercise folder is a **complete solution**, not a TODO skeleton. If you clone, `cat starter.py`, and run `python test.py` to all-green, you'll think "I learned it" — but you haven't written a single line. **Correct learning loop**: `mv starter.py starter_reference.py`, look at signatures (not bodies), write your own, peek at the reference only after 20 min stuck. Full method + per-stage time budgets + escalation order in [`docs/HOW_TO_USE.md`](docs/HOW_TO_USE.md).

Ready? [Start at Stage 0](stages/00-foundations.en.md).

> **English companion to the [繁體中文 canonical README](README.md).**

A learning roadmap for agentic AI — from your first LLM API call to shipping multi-agent production systems. **Structured as a 7-stage path, not a flat list**, with curated projects, hello-world demos, and required reading at every stage.

> Stage detail pages (00-07) and branch files are currently in English; full zh-TW translation is Phase 2 work.

## Why this exists

Most "awesome" lists for AI agents are flat catalogs — useful when you already know what you're looking for, useless when you're trying to figure out **what to learn next**.

This repo is a **structured learning roadmap**:

- 7 stages from prerequisites to production
- Hello-X projects you must run (not just read)
- Curated projects categorized by stage and audience
- English canonical with curated Chinese-language entry points where they exist
- Honest time estimates (14-19 weeks minimum, 5-6 months realistic)

If you're a learner trying to break into agentic AI without getting lost in the noise — this is for you.

## The 7-Stage Learning Map

```
Stage 0  Foundations           (Python · CLI · git · API · JSON)         1-2 週
Stage 1  LLM Fundamentals      (tokens · API · model comparison)         1 週
Stage 2  Prompt Engineering    (system prompts · few-shot · CoT)         1-2 週
Stage 3  Tool Use & Hello Agent ⭐ (function calling · ReAct · 5 hello-X) 2-3 週
Stage 4  Agent Frameworks      (LangGraph · AutoGen · CrewAI · ...)      2-3 週
Stage 5  Claude Code Ecosystem ⭐⭐ (MCP · Skills · Plugins)              3-4 週
Stage 6  Memory · RAG · Advanced (vector DBs · long-term memory)         2 週
Stage 7  Multi-Agent · Production (orchestration · eval · deploy · SDK)  2-4 週
```

**Total main path: 14-19 weeks minimum, ~5-6 months realistic** at 5-8 hr/week part-time. The lower bound assumes you skip Stage 0 and don't get stuck on framework installs.

After main path, choose a specialized branch:
- 🔬 [For Researchers](branches/for-researcher.md)
- 💻 [For Developers](branches/for-developer.md)
- 🎓 [For Teachers](branches/for-teacher.md) — *currently the smallest section; community contributions especially welcome*
- 📊 [For Knowledge Workers](branches/for-knowledge-worker.md)

## Note on self-citation

About a sixth of the curated projects (~12 entries) are repos maintained by this catalog's author (`WenyuChiou/...`). They're included as concrete pattern examples (multi-plugin marketplace, single-plugin bundle, single-skill plugin, sub-CLI delegation, governance layer). Each entry's notes section explains the *pattern* it teaches. If a non-self repo teaches the same pattern more cleanly, please open a PR — see CONTRIBUTING.md.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Skim the 7 stages above** to find where you are.
2. **Click into the matching stage page** (links above). Each page has:
   - Learning goals (what you'll be able to do after)
   - Entry conditions (prerequisites)
   - Required reading (3-5 links)
   - Hello-X projects you must run
   - Curated case-study projects (with my notes on each)
   - Self-check questions before moving on
3. **Don't skip Stage 3 Hello Agent.** Reading without doing the 5 hello-X projects = wasted time.
4. **Stage 5 is where most readers spend the most time.** That's expected.

## Curation Criteria

Every project listed has been evaluated on:

- **Active maintenance** (commits within last 6 months)
- **Quality of documentation** (README clarity, hello-world reproducibility)
- **Educational value** (does it teach a generalizable lesson?)
- **License clarity** (avoid no-license repos)
- **Trustworthiness** (well-known maintainer or org)

Recommendation stars (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐):
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Must-read for the stage
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Highly recommended, study this
- ⭐⭐⭐ — Solid example, worth running
- ⭐⭐ — Useful reference, browse if interested
- ⭐ — Niche / advanced / for completeness

## Phase 1: Current State

This is Phase 1 — the 7-stage spine with anchor curation (~80 projects). Phase 2 work:
- Native zh-TW companion translation
- 100+ additional curated projects
- Self-citation reduction as community contributes alternatives
- Stack-at-a-glance diagram in Stage 5
- `resources/style-guide.md` for terminology consistency

## Contributing

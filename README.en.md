A learning roadmap for agentic AI — **from LLM fundamentals to building multi-agent systems**. Structured 7-stage path: from "what is an LLM, how do tokens work" all the way to multi-agent orchestration and local deployment. Each stage has must-run demos, required reading, and curated projects.

---

## 🎯 Why this exists

If you want to learn AI applications or grow from basics into multi-agent systems — **the most common problem isn't lack of resources, it's not knowing where to start**. Awesome lists in English and Chinese have hundreds of repos but no path; people learning Claude Code, LangGraph, or RAG end up scattered across communities, using different terms, recommending different starter projects.

So we curated **134 high-quality projects** into a "from zero to advanced multi-agent" learning roadmap, organized as **7 stages**. Each stage tells you exactly **what to learn, which Hello-X demos to run, which projects to study, and what self-check to pass before advancing**.

After the main path, you go from "**LLM user**" to "**agent system builder**" — capable of designing multi-agent collaboration, writing your own MCP server, and shipping real agent systems.

## 💡 How to Learn

Welcome — future agent system builder. Some guidance before you start.

This roadmap balances concepts with hands-on work, helping you **transform from an LLM user into an agent system builder**. It assumes **basic Python**. Before starting:

- **Basic Python** — written functions, used APIs, can read JSON
- **Basic git** — clone, commit, push
- **Motivation to learn** — agents are the fastest-changing area in AI 2025+, and require sustained effort

If anything's missing, do Stage 0; if not, **start at Stage 1**.

The main path has 4 parts:

- **Part 1 (Stages 0-2): Foundations & LLM Basics** — Python / git / API, what's an LLM, prompt design
- **Part 2 (Stages 3-4): Build Your Agent** — from tool use to agents, learn the major frameworks
- **Part 3 (Stage 5): Claude Code Ecosystem** — MCP / Skills / Plugins, the heart of the path
- **Part 4 (Stages 6-7): Advanced Integration** — memory / RAG / multi-agent collaboration

After the main path (14-19 weeks), pick a branch.

The most important advice: **don't skip Hello-X demos**. Each stage's Hello-X is "you can't learn this without doing it" — skim past it and you'll get stuck later.

Ready? [Start at Stage 0](stages/00-foundations.en.md).

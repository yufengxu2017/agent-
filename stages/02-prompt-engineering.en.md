# Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering

> [繁體中文](./02-prompt-engineering.md) | [简体中文](./02-prompt-engineering.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks (~5-12 hours)

> 👋 **Coming from [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md)?** Good — you can call an API. The next 5-12 hours: write reusable structured prompts, use few-shot and chain-of-thought for hard reasoning tasks, and quantify prompt improvement with evals. **Jumped straight here?** Make sure you can call an LLM API and estimate cost in tokens — if not, head back to [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md).

> 💡 Term-unfamiliar? (prompt / few-shot / CoT / system prompt / …) → see [`resources/glossary.en.md`](../resources/glossary.en.md).

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Write structured prompts (role + task + format + examples)
- Apply few-shot prompting and know when it helps
- Use chain-of-thought (CoT) for reasoning tasks
- Iteratively refine a prompt and measure improvement
- Recognize when prompting hits its limit (and you need tools / agents)

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to call an LLM API (Stage 1)
- Be able to parse / iterate over API responses

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

> 🦙 **This stage defaults to Ollama gemma4:e4b** (cost-driven; $0/run). Prompt engineering is especially instructive on small models — they are sensitive to prompt quality, so you can clearly see how much each technique (system prompts, few-shot, CoT, refinement) improves output. Every exercise has Path A (Ollama, default) + Path B (Anthropic, optional).
>
> 💰 **Stage 2 budget estimate** (4 exercises, 3-5 runs each): **all local = $0**, **all haiku ≈ $0.20**, **all sonnet ≈ $0.60**. The few-shot classifier alone is 12 calls × 5 reps ≈ $0.30 haiku / $0.90 sonnet. Full budget: [`examples/README.en.md#recommended-llm-list`](../examples/README.en.md#recommended-llm-list).

> Full three-path trade-off in [`examples/README.en.md`](../examples/README.en.md#three-paths--default-is-ollama-cost-driven).

### Exercise 1: System Prompt
Same user message, three different system prompts. Watch the personality / output format change.

<summary>📋 <b>Starter code — Path B (Anthropic API, optional)</b> (copy to <code>practice_1_anthropic.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys, json
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):

json_output = outputs["JSON machine"]
assert "{" in json_output and "}" in json_output
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 1 passed (Anthropic)")
```

**Key difference**: Anthropic uses `system=` parameter; OpenAI/Ollama puts system in messages array. Claude follows system prompts more strictly than gemma4:e4b — the "Strict lawyer" persona will actually cite statute numbers. **Cost**: ~$0.003 / 3 personas.

### Exercise 2: Few-Shot
Pick a classification task. Run it 0-shot, then 3-shot. Measure accuracy difference.

FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = """Examples:

# Rest of TEST_SET / FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES / evaluate() stays identical to Path A
```

**Cost**: 12 calls ≈ $0.005. Claude is usually accurate at 0-shot already, so the few-shot lift is smaller than on gemma4:e4b — that contrast is the actual teaching point.

### Exercise 3: CoT
Pick a math word problem. Compare:
- Plain prompt
- Plain prompt + "Let's think step by step"
- Plain prompt + worked example showing CoT

print(f"\n✅ Exercise 3 passed — {correct}/3 correct")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code — Path B (Anthropic API, optional)</b> (copy to <code>practice_3_anthropic.py</code>)</summary>

Same logic as Path A, just swap the client and `ask()`:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

def ask(prompt: str) -> str:
    msg = client.messages.create(model="claude-haiku-4-5", max_tokens=300,
                                 messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
    return msg.content[0].text
# Rest (QUESTION, ANSWER, COT_EXAMPLE, extract_number, 3 calls, assert) stays identical
```

**Claude typically gets 3/3 right** including the plain-prompt baseline — that contrast with gemma4:e4b (where CoT is essential) is the actual teaching point. **Cost**: 3 calls ≈ $0.002.

</details>

> 🧠 **When NOT to hand-write CoT**: for **reasoning-native models** (Claude Opus 4.x, the o-series, Gemini thinking, and other models with built-in thinking), using their extended thinking is usually better than hand-writing "Let's think step by step"; forcing your own steps can interfere with their native reasoning. Hand-written CoT still applies to plain chat models without built-in reasoning.

### Exercise 4: Iterative Refinement
Take a vague prompt, refine it 5 times. Track the iterations. Notice what changes improve quality.

v5_has_banned = any(w in v5_text_lower for w in banned_words)
assert v5_len > 0, "v5 must have output"
assert not v5_has_banned, f"v5 should avoid banned words; got: {[w for w in banned_words if w in v5_text_lower]}"
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 4 passed — v5 length {v5_len}, no banned words")
print(f"💡 Observe: v1 ({v1_len} chars) is typically looser than v5 ({v5_len} chars); constraints tighten prompts")
print("💡 The 5 dimensions: (1) target audience (2) format (3) length (4) example demand (5) banned words")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code — Path B (Anthropic API, optional)</b> (copy to <code>practice_4_anthropic.py</code>)</summary>

Same loop and PROMPTS as Path A, with Anthropic SDK:

```python
import anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

outputs = {}
for label, prompt in PROMPTS.items():
    msg = client.messages.create(model="claude-haiku-4-5", max_tokens=200,
                                 messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
    outputs[label] = msg.content[0].text
# Rest (length compare, banned-word assert) stays identical
```

**Cost**: 5 calls ≈ $0.002. **Claude's v1 is already coherent** so the v5 lift is smaller; gemma4:e4b makes the lift more dramatic.

## 🔭 Advanced: The Three Layers of Prompt → Context → Harness Engineering

Engineering practice for LLM-powered systems can be divided into **three stack layers**. This is not about "one call vs. many calls." Each layer engineers a different object:

- **Prompt Engineering** (this stage) = engineering **the string sent into the model**
- **Context Engineering** (Stage 6) = engineering **what information goes into the context window on each call** — dynamically assembling RAG retrieval results, memory, tool definitions, and conversation history
- **Harness Engineering** (Stage 7) = engineering **the execution and control layer around the model** — agent loops, retry, sandboxing, observability, deployment, and all other non-LLM code

→ The three layers are **orthogonal**: a one-call RAG app is still doing context engineering (the point is assembling context, not how many calls happen); a 50-call chatbot with no retrieval is still only doing prompt engineering.

**Full three-layer lineage in this roadmap**:

| Discipline | What is being engineered | Where this roadmap teaches it fully |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Prompt Engineering** | The string sent into the LLM itself (system prompt / few-shot / format) | **This stage (Stage 2)** |
| **2. Context Engineering** | What information goes into the context window (RAG / memory / tool defs / history) | [Stage 6 — Context Engineering: RAG and Memory](06-memory-rag.en.md) |
| **3. Harness Engineering** | The execution and control layer around the model (agent loop / retry / sandbox / observability) | [Stage 7 — Multi-Agent · Productionization](07-multi-agent-production.en.md) |

> 💡 **Karpathy 2025-06**: context engineering is the delicate art of putting information that is **just useful for the next step** into the context window.
>
> 💡 **Simon Willison / Addy Osmani**: "coding agent = LLM + harness"; a harness is all the code that is not the model itself. [OpenAI also used the term "Harness Engineering" in February 2026](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering).

**You do not need to finish the latter two layers in this stage**. This section only gives you the direction so that Stage 6 / 7 feel like a continuation of the same lineage.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 3

Can you:
- [ ] Write a prompt with system message + user message + 3 example messages (few-shot)
- [ ] Demonstrate CoT improving accuracy on a reasoning task
- [ ] Iteratively refine a prompt 5 times tracking each version
- [ ] Identify when prompting is the wrong tool (and tool use is needed)

If yes → proceed to [Stage 3 — Tool Use & Agent Intro](03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md). This is the most important stage — don't rush past prompts but also don't get stuck here.

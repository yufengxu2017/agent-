# Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering

> [繁體中文](./02-prompt-engineering.md) | [简体中文](./02-prompt-engineering.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks (~5-12 hours)

> 👋 **Coming from [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md)?** Good — you can call an API. The next 5-12 hours: write reusable structured prompts, use few-shot and chain-of-thought for hard reasoning tasks, and quantify prompt improvement with evals. **Jumped straight here?** Make sure you can call an LLM API and estimate cost in tokens — if not, head back to [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md).

> 💡 Term-unfamiliar? (prompt / few-shot / CoT / system prompt / …) → see [`resources/glossary.en.md`](../resources/glossary.en.md).

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Write structured prompts (role + task + format + examples)
- Apply few-shot prompting and know when it helps
- Use chain-of-thought (CoT) for reasoning tasks
- Iteratively refine a prompt and measure improvement
- Recognize when prompting hits its limit (and you need tools / agents)

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to call an LLM API (Stage 1)
- Be able to parse / iterate over API responses

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

> 🦙 **This stage defaults to Ollama gemma3n:e4b** (cost-driven; $0/run). Prompt engineering is especially instructive on small models — they are sensitive to prompt quality, so you can clearly see how much each technique (system prompts, few-shot, CoT, refinement) improves output. Every exercise has Path A (Ollama, default) + Path B (Anthropic, optional).

### Exercise 1: System Prompt
Same user message, three different system prompts. Watch the personality / output format change.

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_1.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

SYSTEM_PROMPTS = {
    "Strict lawyer": "You are a precise contract lawyer. Cite statute numbers, avoid subjective adjectives.",
    "Kindergarten teacher": "You are a kind kindergarten teacher speaking to a 5-year-old. Use analogies, colloquial language, under 80 words.",
    "JSON machine": "Reply only in JSON. schema: {\"answer\": string, \"confidence\": float}",
}

USER_MSG = "Explain what a lease agreement is."

for label, system in SYSTEM_PROMPTS.items():
    msg = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=200,
        system=system,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": USER_MSG}],
    )
    print(f"\n--- [{label}] ---")
    print(msg.content[0].text)

# === Self-check ===
import json
last_text = msg.content[0].text  # last iteration = JSON machine
assert "{" in last_text and "}" in last_text, "JSON-machine output should contain JSON braces"
try:
    parsed = json.loads(last_text.strip().split("\n")[-1] if "\n" in last_text else last_text)
    assert "answer" in parsed, "schema expects an 'answer' field"
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    pass  # some models add prose around the JSON; tolerate that

print(f"\n✅ Exercise 1 passed — same question, three different personas / formats / tones")
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: Anthropic uses a `system=` parameter; OpenAI-compatible SDKs (including Ollama) put system in the first message: `messages=[{"role": "system", "content": ...}, {"role": "user", "content": ...}]`. Everything else is identical.

</details>

### Exercise 2: Few-Shot
Pick a classification task. Run it 0-shot, then 3-shot. Measure accuracy difference.

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_2.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Sentiment classifier: positive / negative / neutral
TEST_SET = [
    ("This movie was amazing — I want to watch it again!", "positive"),
    ("Boring plot, awkward acting.", "negative"),
    ("This is a 2019 film.", "neutral"),
    ("Not sure how I feel about it, might think more.", "neutral"),
    ("Season 1 was great but season 2 fell apart.", "negative"),
    ("Left in a great mood — recommended!", "positive"),
]

FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = """Examples:
input: The steak at this place made me cry tears of joy.
output: positive

input: The waiter was rude. Never coming back.
output: negative

input: This shop is in New Taipei City.
output: neutral
"""


def classify(text: str, *, use_few_shot: bool) -> str:
    prefix = FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES + "\n" if use_few_shot else ""
    prompt = f"{prefix}input: {text}\noutput:"
    msg = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=10,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    return msg.content[0].text.strip().splitlines()[0]


def evaluate(use_few_shot: bool) -> tuple[int, int]:
    correct = 0
    for text, label in TEST_SET:
        pred = classify(text, use_few_shot=use_few_shot)
        ok = label in pred
        print(f"  {'✓' if ok else '✗'} [{label}] {text[:30]}... → '{pred}'")
        if ok:
            correct += 1
    return correct, len(TEST_SET)


print("=== 0-shot ===")
c0, n = evaluate(use_few_shot=False)
print(f"correct {c0}/{n} = {c0/n:.0%}")

print("\n=== 3-shot ===")
c3, _ = evaluate(use_few_shot=True)
print(f"correct {c3}/{n} = {c3/n:.0%}")

# === Self-check ===
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 2 passed — 0-shot {c0}/{n}, 3-shot {c3}/{n}")
assert c3 >= c0, f"expected 3-shot ≥ 0-shot, got {c3} < {c0}"
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: few-shot prompts typically lift small models (gemma3n:e4b) by an even **larger** margin — smaller models depend more on examples for calibration. SDK swap matches Exercise 1 Path B.

</details>

### Exercise 3: CoT
Pick a math word problem. Compare:
- Plain prompt
- Plain prompt + "Let's think step by step"
- Plain prompt + worked example showing CoT

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_3.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys, re
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

QUESTION = "Tom has 3 apples. He gives Sarah 1, then mom gives him 5 more, then he eats 2. How many does he have now?"
ANSWER = 5  # 3 - 1 + 5 - 2 = 5

COT_EXAMPLE = """Example:
Q: A chicken has 2 legs. 3 chickens and 1 person — how many legs total?
A: Let me work through this step by step. 3 chickens × 2 legs = 6 legs. 1 person has 2 legs. Total 6 + 2 = 8 legs. The answer is 8.
"""


def ask(prompt: str) -> str:
    msg = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=300,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    return msg.content[0].text


def extract_number(text: str) -> int | None:
    """Pull the last number from the response as the answer."""
    nums = re.findall(r"-?\d+", text)
    return int(nums[-1]) if nums else None


out_a = ask(QUESTION)
ans_a = extract_number(out_a)

out_b = ask(QUESTION + "\nLet's think step by step.")
ans_b = extract_number(out_b)

out_c = ask(COT_EXAMPLE + "\n\nQ: " + QUESTION + "\nA:")
ans_c = extract_number(out_c)

for label, out, ans in [("A plain", out_a, ans_a), ("B +step-by-step", out_b, ans_b), ("C +CoT example", out_c, ans_c)]:
    print(f"\n--- [{label}] answer={ans} {'✓' if ans == ANSWER else '✗'} ---")
    print(out[:200])

# === Self-check ===
correct = sum(1 for a in (ans_a, ans_b, ans_c) if a == ANSWER)
assert correct >= 1, f"at least 1 of 3 prompts should be correct, got {correct}/3"
assert ans_b == ANSWER or ans_c == ANSWER, "B (step-by-step) or C (CoT example) must be correct — CoT is non-negotiable for small models"
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 3 passed — {correct}/3 correct")
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: CoT is **essential** for small models like gemma3n:e4b — without step-by-step they fail this almost completely. Use this exercise to measure how strongly each model depends on CoT.

</details>

### Exercise 4: Iterative Refinement
Take a vague prompt, refine it 5 times. Track the iterations. Notice what changes improve quality.

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_4.py</code>) — this exercise has no "right answer"; the point is observing the process</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# 5 iterations, each adds one constraint
PROMPTS = {
    "v1 vague": "Write a paragraph about ReAct.",
    "v2 +audience": "Write a paragraph about ReAct for software engineers who know Python.",
    "v3 +format": "Write a paragraph about ReAct for software engineers who know Python. Under 100 words, single paragraph.",
    "v4 +example": "Write a paragraph about ReAct for software engineers who know Python. Under 100 words, single paragraph, ending with a concrete example (e.g. weather lookup).",
    "v5 +bans": "Write a paragraph about ReAct for software engineers who know Python. Under 100 words, single paragraph, ending with a concrete example (e.g. weather lookup). Avoid words like 'empower', 'leverage', 'intelligent'.",
}

outputs = {}
for label, prompt in PROMPTS.items():
    msg = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        max_tokens=200,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )
    text = msg.content[0].text
    outputs[label] = text
    print(f"\n--- [{label}] ({len(text)} chars) ---")
    print(text)

# === Self-check ===
v1_len, v5_len = len(outputs["v1 vague"]), len(outputs["v5 +bans"])
banned_words = ("empower", "leverage", "intelligent")
v5_text_lower = outputs["v5 +bans"].lower()
v5_has_banned = any(w in v5_text_lower for w in banned_words)
assert v5_len > 0, "v5 must have output"
assert not v5_has_banned, f"v5 should avoid banned words; got: {[w for w in banned_words if w in v5_text_lower]}"
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 4 passed — v5 length {v5_len}, no banned words")
print(f"💡 Observe: v1 ({v1_len} chars) is typically looser than v5 ({v5_len} chars); constraints tighten prompts")
print("💡 The 5 dimensions: (1) target audience (2) format (3) length (4) example demand (5) banned words")
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: running 5 refine iterations on gemma3n:e4b is especially instructive — you'll watch "v1 vague" struggle to produce anything useful and "v5 +bans" show the biggest jump. Small models are highly sensitive to prompt quality, which makes them an excellent sparring partner for prompt engineering.

## 🔭 Beyond prompts: context engineering

When you find that **a single prompt can no longer cover the problem** — and you need to dynamically assemble system prompt + retrieved chunks + memory + tool definitions + multi-turn history — you've graduated from prompt engineering to **context engineering**. It's the next layer up.

**Don't try to learn it now**, just know the direction:

- You'll first hit it in [Stage 6 (Memory · RAG)](06-memory-rag.en.md) (what data goes into the prompt)
- You'll fully face it in [Stage 7 (Multi-Agent · Production)](07-multi-agent-production.en.md) (context window budget, memory layering, observability)

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 3

Can you:
- [ ] Write a prompt with system message + user message + 3 example messages (few-shot)
- [ ] Demonstrate CoT improving accuracy on a reasoning task
- [ ] Iteratively refine a prompt 5 times tracking each version
- [ ] Identify when prompting is the wrong tool (and tool use is needed)

If yes → proceed to [Stage 3 — Tool Use & Agent Intro](03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md). This is the most important stage — don't rush past prompts but also don't get stuck here.

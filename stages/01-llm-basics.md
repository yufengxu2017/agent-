# Stage 1 — LLM Fundamentals

⏱ **Time estimate**: 1 week (~5-8 hours)

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Explain what an LLM is, what tokens are, and what context window means
- Make your first API call to Claude / GPT / Gemini and parse the response
- Compare the four major LLM families (Claude / GPT / Gemini / Llama) on strengths
- Estimate cost per task using per-token pricing

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to run a Python script
- Know what HTTP / REST is conceptually
- Have an API key from at least one provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google)

If not — go back to Stage 0 first.

2. [**OpenAI Quickstart**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) — first API call walkthrough
3. [**A Visual Guide to LLM Tokenizers**](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter6/1) — Hugging Face's intro
4. [**Anthropic API Pricing**](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api) — read the pricing table, calculate cost for 1k input + 1k output

## 🛠 Hello-X Projects (must run, not just read)

### Hello, LLM API
Five-line Python script that calls Claude API and prints the response.

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}]
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
```

### Hello, Tokens
Run the same prompt 100 times and watch token counts vary.
- Notice: temperature ≠ 0 produces variation
- Notice: token count for the SAME English vs Chinese sentence

### Hello, Pricing
Calculate the actual dollar cost of running 1000 inferences for your hello-world prompt. Use Anthropic's pricing page + count tokens via the SDK's `usage` field.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 2

Can you:
- [ ] Make a Claude API call from Python in 5 lines
- [ ] Explain why "你好" might use 2 tokens but "Hello" uses 1
- [ ] Quote roughly the per-token price for Claude Sonnet vs Opus
- [ ] Name one strength of Claude vs GPT vs Gemini vs Llama

If yes → proceed to [Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering](02-prompt-engineering.md).

If no → re-read the Anthropic Quickstart + run all 3 hello-X projects above.

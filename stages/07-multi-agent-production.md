# Stage 7 — Multi-Agent · Production

⏱ **Time estimate**: 2-4 weeks (~15-30 hours)

The final stage. You're moving from "I can build agents" to "I can run them in production with multiple agents coordinating, evaluation, observability, and deployment."

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Design multi-agent orchestration patterns (debate, planner-executor, peer review)
- Set up evaluation harness for agents
- Add observability (tracing, logging, cost tracking)
- Use Anthropic SDK / OpenAI SDK for production deployment (advanced features: streaming, prompt caching, batching)
- Deploy agents to production (Docker, serverless, monitoring)

## 📚 Required Reading

1. [**Anthropic — Building Effective Agents**](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) — re-read with production lens
2. [**Anthropic — Prompt Caching**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching) — 90% cost reduction technique
3. [**Anthropic — Message Batches API**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) — async batch jobs
4. **One eval framework's docs** — promptfoo OR LangSmith OR weave

## 🛠 Hello-X

- **Hello Multi-Agent** — 2 agents debating a topic, 3rd agent judging
- **Hello Eval** — write evals for an agent, measure success rate across N runs
- **Hello Observability** — connect LangSmith / Helicone / weave to an agent, view trace
- **Hello SDK Advanced** — use streaming + prompt caching + tool use in one call
- **Hello Deploy** — package an agent in Docker, deploy to cloud (any platform)

## ✅ Self-Check After Stage 7

Can you:
- [ ] Design a multi-agent system with explicit coordination protocol
- [ ] Set up automated eval pipeline running in CI
- [ ] Connect observability (tracing) to a production agent
- [ ] Use prompt caching to cut costs by 50%+ on a real workload
- [ ] Deploy an agent to a cloud service (any provider)

If yes → you've completed the main path. Choose a [specialized branch](../README.md#the-7-stage-learning-map) or contribute to this repo.

## 💡 What's Next

You now have foundational competence. The next 6-12 months should be about:
1. **Pick one production system** to take from prototype → production
2. **Contribute to upstream** (LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP servers, Anthropic cookbook)
3. **Read papers** — agent research is moving fast
4. **Build something visible** — open source a real tool, not another tutorial

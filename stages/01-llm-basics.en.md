# Stage 1 — LLM Fundamentals

⏱ **Time estimate**: 1 week (~5-8 hours)

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Explain what an LLM is, what tokens are, and what context window means
- Make your first API call to Claude / GPT / Gemini and parse the response
- Compare the four major LLM families (Claude / GPT / Gemini / Llama) on strengths
- Estimate cost per task using per-token pricing

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to run a Python script
- Know what HTTP / REST is conceptually
- Have an API key from at least one provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google)

If not — go back to Stage 0 first.

## 📚 Required Reading

1. [**Anthropic — What is Claude?**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) — official model overview
2. [**OpenAI Quickstart**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) — first API call walkthrough
3. [**A Visual Guide to LLM Tokenizers**](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter6/1) — Hugging Face's intro
4. [**Anthropic API Pricing**](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api) — read the pricing table, calculate cost for 1k input + 1k output

## 🛠 Hello-X Projects (must run, not just read)

### Hello, LLM API
Five-line Python script that calls Claude API and prints the response.

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}]
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
```

### Hello, Tokens
Run the same prompt 100 times and watch token counts vary.
- Notice: temperature ≠ 0 produces variation
- Notice: token count for the SAME English vs Chinese sentence

### Hello, Pricing
Calculate the actual dollar cost of running 1000 inferences for your hello-world prompt. Use Anthropic's pricing page + count tokens via the SDK's `usage` field.

### Hello, Cross-Provider Comparison
Send the same prompt to Claude, GPT, and Gemini simultaneously, compare their responses. Notice "why does the same input produce different answers" — answer style, length, and judgment all differ. Use the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google SDKs side-by-side.

### Hello, Error Handling
Trigger error conditions deliberately and write retry logic:
- Wrong API key → see how it raises
- Over-long prompt → what happens when the context window is full
- Network drop → write a retry wrapper with exponential backoff
This is foundational for Stage 3-7's production agent code.

### Hello, Local LLM
**No API fees, runs on your machine**: use Ollama to pull a small model (recommend `llama3.2:3b` or `qwen2.5:3b`), call it via OpenAI-compatible API.
```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
ollama serve  # default port 11434
```
Then from Python:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1", api_key="ollama")
r = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen2.5:3b",
    messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Explain ReAct in 3 sentences"}]
)
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```
**Why do this**: once you can run local LLMs, Stage 3-6 experiments aren't bottlenecked on API costs; privacy-sensitive work also stays offline.

### 🖥️ Running LLMs Locally (no API fees)

The four entries below are tools to **run LLMs on your own machine** — useful after Hello-Local-LLM, and the answer for privacy-sensitive work, cost-sensitive experiments, or offline scenarios.

**What it teaches**: The easiest local LLM runner — one `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b` and you have a working model with built-in OpenAI-compatible API (`http://localhost:11434/v1`); existing OpenAI SDK code barely needs to change.

**Best for**: First-time local LLM users. Also useful as fallback in agent dev — main path on Claude, cost-sensitive parts on Ollama.

**Run it**:
```bash
# Download from https://ollama.com
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b   # ~2GB, decent Chinese support
ollama run qwen2.5:3b    # interactive chat

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 2

Can you:
- [ ] Make a Claude API call from Python in 5 lines
- [ ] Explain why "你好" might use 2 tokens but "Hello" uses 1
- [ ] Quote roughly the per-token price for Claude Sonnet vs Opus
- [ ] Name one strength of Claude vs GPT vs Gemini vs Llama

If yes → proceed to [Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering](02-prompt-engineering.md).

If no → re-read the Anthropic Quickstart + run all 3 hello-X projects above.

# Stage 1 — LLM Fundamentals

> [繁體中文](./01-llm-basics.md) | [简体中文](./01-llm-basics.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 1 week (~5-8 hours)

> 👋 **Coming from [Stage 0](00-foundations.en.md)?** Nice — your toolchain is set. The next 5-8 hours: your first working call to Claude / GPT / Gemini, how token / context window / temperature shape the output, and per-token cost estimation. **Jumped straight here?** Make sure you can run a Python script and have an API key from one provider — if not, head back to [Stage 0](00-foundations.en.md).

> 💡 **Don't recognize a term?** (LLM / token / context window / temperature / RAG / agent / …) → check [`resources/glossary.en.md`](../resources/glossary.en.md) for 30-second definitions.

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Explain what an LLM is, what tokens are, and what context window means
- Make your first API call to Claude / GPT / Gemini and parse the response
- Compare the four major LLM families (Claude / GPT / Gemini / Llama) on strengths
- Estimate cost per task using per-token pricing

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to run a Python script
- Know what HTTP / REST is conceptually
- Have an API key from at least one provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google)

If not — go back to Stage 0 first.

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises (do them, not just read)

> 🦙 **This stage defaults to Ollama** (cost-driven; `gemma3n:e4b` runs locally for $0/run). Every exercise has Path A (Ollama, default) + Path B (Anthropic, optional — use it when you want to see cloud-quality answers). Full three-path trade-off in [`examples/README.en.md`](../examples/README.en.md#three-paths--default-is-ollama-cost-driven).
>
> 💰 **Don't have Ollama yet?** Each exercise also includes a Path B block running on Anthropic — pick one. To enable Path A in one step: [`pip install openai && ollama pull gemma3n:e4b`](https://ollama.com).

### Exercise 1: LLM API (hello world)
Five-line Python script that calls an LLM and prints the response. **Defaults to local Ollama (free, offline)**; switch to Path B Anthropic when you want cloud-quality answers. Details in [`examples/README.en.md`](../examples/README.en.md#three-paths--default-is-ollama-cost-driven).

<details open>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code — Path A (local Ollama gemma3n:e4b, default)</b> (copy to <code>practice_1.py</code> and run <code>python practice_1.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install openai      (OpenAI-compatible SDK talks to Ollama)
# Pre-req: ollama pull gemma3n:e4b && ollama serve
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    api_key="ollama",  # Ollama doesn't check this — anything works
)

r = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemma3n:e4b",   # swap to qwen2.5:3b / llama3.2:3b if preferred
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself in one sentence."}],
)

# === Self-check ===
text = r.choices[0].message.content
print("Response:", text)
print("usage:", r.usage)

assert r.choices[0].finish_reason in ("stop", "length"), f"unexpected finish_reason: {r.choices[0].finish_reason}"
assert len(text) > 0, "response should not be empty"
assert r.usage.completion_tokens > 0, "output token count should be > 0"
print("✅ Exercise 1 passed — local Ollama gemma3n:e4b answered for $0")
```

**How slow?** Gemma 4B on CPU: ~5-30 s/answer; on GPU (RTX 3060+): <2 s. For speed use `gemma3:1b`; for quality use `qwen2.5:14b` / `llama3.3:8b` (needs 8 GB+ VRAM).

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code — Path B (Anthropic API, optional, when you want cloud quality)</b> (copy to <code>practice_1_anthropic.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
# Env: export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-haiku-4-5",  # haiku = cheapest; switch to sonnet by changing this line
    max_tokens=100,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself in one sentence."}],
)

# === Self-check ===
text = msg.content[0].text
print("Response:", text)
print("usage:", msg.usage)

assert msg.stop_reason in ("end_turn", "max_tokens"), f"unexpected stop_reason: {msg.stop_reason}"
assert len(text) > 0, "response should not be empty"
assert msg.usage.input_tokens > 0 and msg.usage.output_tokens > 0, "token counts should be > 0"
print("✅ Exercise 1 passed — Anthropic API is reachable from your machine")
```

**Cost**: ~$0.001/run (haiku) or ~$0.004/run (sonnet); this hello-world is also 5-15× faster than Ollama.

</details>

### Exercise 2: Tokens
Run the same prompt 100 times and watch token counts vary.
- Notice: `temperature ≠ 0` produces variation
- Notice: token count for the SAME English vs Chinese sentence

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_2.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys, statistics
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

PROMPTS = {
    "Chinese": "用一句話描述一隻貓在做什麼。",
    "English": "Describe in one sentence what a cat is doing.",
}

N = 20  # 100 runs is expensive — start with 20
for label, prompt in PROMPTS.items():
    output_tokens = []
    for _ in range(N):
        msg = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-haiku-4-5",
            max_tokens=80,
            temperature=1.0,  # high temp to amplify variance
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        )
        output_tokens.append(msg.usage.output_tokens)
    print(f"\n[{label}] prompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"  input tokens: {msg.usage.input_tokens}")
    print(f"  output tokens — min={min(output_tokens)} max={max(output_tokens)} mean={statistics.mean(output_tokens):.1f} stdev={statistics.stdev(output_tokens):.1f}")

# === Self-check ===
print("\n✅ Exercise 2 passed — observed how temperature affects output token variance")
print("💡 Chinese prompts typically use MORE input tokens (one Chinese character ≈ 2 tokens)")
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: swap `client.messages.create(...)` for the OpenAI-compatible `client.chat.completions.create(...)`; replace `msg.usage.output_tokens` with `r.usage.completion_tokens`. Full Path B pattern: see Exercise 1.

</details>

### Exercise 3: Pricing
Calculate the actual dollar cost of running 1000 inferences for your hello-world prompt. Use Anthropic's pricing page + count tokens via the SDK's `usage` field.

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_3.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

import anthropic

# Anthropic public pricing 2026 Q1 (per 1M tokens, USD)
# Verify at https://www.anthropic.com/pricing before relying on these numbers
PRICING = {
    "claude-haiku-4-5":   {"input": 1.00, "output":  5.00},
    "claude-sonnet-4-5":  {"input": 3.00, "output": 15.00},
    "claude-opus-4-5":    {"input": 15.0, "output": 75.00},
}

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"

msg = client.messages.create(
    model=MODEL,
    max_tokens=200,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Please introduce yourself."}],
)
in_tok = msg.usage.input_tokens
out_tok = msg.usage.output_tokens
rates = PRICING[MODEL]

cost_one = (in_tok * rates["input"] + out_tok * rates["output"]) / 1_000_000
cost_1000 = cost_one * 1000

print(f"model: {MODEL}")
print(f"single call: input={in_tok} output={out_tok} → ${cost_one:.6f}")
print(f"1000 calls:   ${cost_1000:.4f}")

print("\nProjected cost across models (same token counts):")
for name, r in PRICING.items():
    c = (in_tok * r["input"] + out_tok * r["output"]) / 1_000_000 * 1000
    print(f"  {name:<22} 1000 calls: ${c:.4f}")

# === Self-check ===
assert cost_1000 > 0, "cost should be > 0"
assert cost_1000 < 10, f"1000 haiku hello-worlds should not exceed $10, got ${cost_1000:.4f}"
print(f"\n✅ Exercise 3 passed — you can now compute real cost from usage + pricing")
```

> 🦙 **Ollama equivalent**: local models have no pricing — `cost_1000 = 0` — but you can log latency instead (`time.time() - t0`). Pricing matters in Stage 7 production work; for the Ollama path you can skip this exercise or track "kWh of your electricity bill".

</details>

### Exercise 4: Cross-Provider Comparison
Send the same prompt to Claude, GPT, and Gemini simultaneously, compare their responses. Notice "why does the same input produce different answers" — answer style, length, and judgment all differ. Use the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google SDKs side-by-side.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-1/04-cross-provider/`](../examples/stage-1/04-cross-provider/) (parallel calls to all three SDKs + comparison table; missing keys are skipped gracefully)

### Exercise 5: Error Handling
Trigger error conditions deliberately and write retry logic:
- Wrong API key → see how it raises
- Over-long prompt → what happens when the context window is full
- Network drop → write a retry wrapper with exponential backoff

This is foundational for Stage 3-7's production agent code.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-1/05-error-handling/`](../examples/stage-1/05-error-handling/) (mock-based tests so you can verify the retry logic without unplugging your ethernet cable)

### Exercise 6: Local LLM
**No API fees, runs on your machine**: use Ollama to pull a small model (recommend `llama3.2:3b` or `qwen2.5:3b`), call it via OpenAI-compatible API.

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
ollama serve  # default port 11434
```

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_6.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install openai
# Pre-req: Ollama is running, qwen2.5:3b is pulled
import sys
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    api_key="ollama",  # Ollama doesn't check this — anything works
)

r = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen2.5:3b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain ReAct in 3 sentences."}],
)

text = r.choices[0].message.content
print("Response:", text)

# === Self-check ===
assert len(text) > 10, "response is too short — Ollama may not be running"
print(f"✅ Exercise 6 passed — local Ollama reachable through the OpenAI-compatible API")
print(f"💡 This run cost you $0 (except for electricity)")
```

**Why do this**: once you can run local LLMs, Stage 3-6 experiments aren't bottlenecked on API costs; privacy-sensitive work also stays offline.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 2

Can you:
- [ ] Make a Claude API call from Python in 5 lines
- [ ] Explain why "你好" might use 2 tokens but "Hello" uses 1
- [ ] Quote roughly the per-token price for Claude Sonnet vs Opus
- [ ] Name one strength of Claude vs GPT vs Gemini vs Llama

If yes → proceed to [Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering](02-prompt-engineering.en.md).

If no → re-read the Anthropic Quickstart + run all 3 hello-X projects above.

---

> ✅ **Done with Stage 1?** Next, [**Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering**](02-prompt-engineering.en.md) takes 5-12 hours to walk you through writing reusable structured prompts, using few-shot and chain-of-thought for reasoning tasks, and learning to quantify prompt improvement with evals. **Keep going →**

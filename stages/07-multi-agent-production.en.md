# Stage 7 — Multi-Agent · Production

⏱ **Time estimate**: 2-4 weeks (~15-30 hours)

The final stage. You're moving from "I can build agents" to "I can run them in production with multiple agents coordinating, evaluation, observability, and deployment."

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Design multi-agent orchestration patterns (debate, planner-executor, peer review)
- Set up evaluation harness for agents
- Add observability (tracing, logging, cost tracking)
- Use Anthropic SDK / OpenAI SDK for production deployment (advanced features: streaming, prompt caching, batching)
- Deploy agents to production (Docker, serverless, monitoring)

## 📚 Required Reading

1. [**Anthropic — Building Effective Agents**](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) — re-read with production lens
2. [**Anthropic — Prompt Caching**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching) — 90% cost reduction technique
3. [**Anthropic — Message Batches API**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) — async batch jobs
4. **One eval framework's docs** — promptfoo OR LangSmith OR weave

## 🛠 Hello-X Projects (must run, not just read)

### Hello-1: Multi-Agent debate
Two agents debate a topic (e.g. "Python vs Rust for backend"), a third agent judges. Watch for convergence vs divergence patterns.

### Hello-2: Eval
Write an eval for one of your earlier agents, run it N times, measure success rate. Replace "I'll just eyeball it."

### Hello-3: Observability
Connect LangSmith / Helicone / weave to an agent, view the full trace. Understand: "agent debugging without observability = black box."

### Hello-4: SDK advanced
Use streaming + prompt caching + tool use in one call. Watch how cost drops.

### Hello-5: Deploy
Package an agent in Docker, deploy to cloud (any provider). Learn to ship a prototype as something others can run.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 6k+ |
| License | MIT |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: Anthropic's **agent-specific SDK** (released mid-2025) — distinct from the lower-level `anthropic-sdk-python`. Built-in tool use loop, file access, sandboxed execution, subagent orchestration. Exposes Claude Code's agent capabilities for Python apps to use directly.

**Best for**: Developers building Claude-based agents rather than just calling the API. Saves you from hand-rolling a ReAct loop, managing tool execution, etc.

**Notes**: Shares the same agent runtime as Claude Code; reading this SDK's source is the fastest path to understanding how Claude Code works internally.

**What it teaches**: SOP-driven multi-agent software development team — PM / Architect / Engineer roles each producing artifacts (PRD → design → code) and handing off to the next role.

**Best for**: Seeing how the **role-specialization + artifact handoff** pattern is implemented. A different design path from LangGraph's state-machine approach.

**Notes**: Maintained by a Chinese team; the docs site has zh content. Worth comparing against AutoGen's free-form group chat.

**Best for**: After learning tool use in Stages 3-4, understand "**why tool design matters more than prompt tuning**."

**Notes**: Paper + open-source code — a great reference for academic multi-agent research.

## ✅ Self-Check After Stage 7

Can you:
- [ ] Design a multi-agent system with explicit coordination protocol
- [ ] Set up automated eval pipeline running in CI
- [ ] Connect observability (tracing) to a production agent
- [ ] Measure and compare cost before/after prompt caching on a real workload
- [ ] Deploy an agent to a cloud service (any provider)

If yes → you've completed the main path. Choose a [specialized branch](../README.en.md#the-7-stage-learning-map) or contribute to this repo.

## 💡 What's Next

You now have foundational competence. The next 6-12 months should be about:
1. **Pick one production system** to take from prototype → production
2. **Contribute to upstream** (LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP servers, Anthropic cookbook)
3. **Read papers** — agent research is moving fast
4. **Build something visible** — open source a real tool, not another tutorial

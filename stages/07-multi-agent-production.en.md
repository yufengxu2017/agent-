# Stage 7 — Multi-Agent · Productionization

> [繁體中文](./07-multi-agent-production.md) | [简体中文](./07-multi-agent-production.zh-Hans.md) | **English**

⏱ **Estimated Time**: 2-4 weeks (approx. 15-30 hours)

> 💡 High density of terminology (multi-agent / handoff / eval / observability / guardrails...) → Refer to [`resources/glossary.md` 4 + 6](../resources/glossary.md#4-multi-agent).

> 📋 **Chapter Composition**: [What is Multi-Agent · Productionization (Positioning) + Three-layer engineering split + When to use multi-agent] → Learning Objectives → Entry Conditions → Required Reading → Harness Engineering (**8 core components including Cost/Latency**) → Hands-on Exercises (including Exercise 6 Cost Optimization) → **Agent Benchmark Landscape: how to read it, not just the leaderboard** → Recommended Tools → Featured Projects → Self-Check
> 🔑 **Key Terms**: See [`resources/glossary.md` 4 + 6](../resources/glossary.md#4-multi-agent) (multi-agent / orchestration / handoff / eval / observability / harness (the execution and control layer around the model))

This is the final stage. You are moving from "I can build an agent" to "I can make an agent **truly stable for people to use**"—with multiple agents collaborating, with eval, with observability, and deployable to a usable environment. **"Productionization" ≠ enterprise scale**—as long as an agent can produce stable output and be used by others, it falls within the scope of this stage.

## 🎯 What Is Multi-Agent · Productionization (Positioning)

**This stage = how multiple agents collaborate + how to push an agent from prototype to the point where others can use it stably.** Three sentences clarify the scope:

- **It is not just about learning frameworks** — Stage 4 already taught how to choose frameworks
- **It does not have to be enterprise scale** — as long as an agent can be used by others, it counts as productionization
- **The core is harness engineering** — 8 core components + eval + observability + cost / latency control

**Division of labor with adjacent stages**:

- **Stage 4** = how to choose a single-agent framework, patterns like ReAct / Plan-Execute
- **This stage** = **multi-agent collaboration** + **harness engineering** (execution-system engineering) + **deployment to a usable environment / observability / eval**

### The three-layer engineering split: Prompt → Context → Harness

Engineering work can be split into three layers, corresponding to different positions in the stack (not the difference between one call and many calls):

| Layer | Concept | Core question | Unit of concern | Corresponding stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prompt Engineering** | How should I ask this time? | **single LLM call** | [Stage 2](02-prompt-engineering.md) |
| 2 | **Context Engineering** | What information should the model receive this time? | **context across multiple interactions** | [Stage 6](06-memory-rag.md) |
| **3** | **Harness Engineering**<br>(**This stage**) | How does the whole workflow run? | **executable LLM workflow / system** | **This stage** |

> 🔁 **The next layer: Loop Engineering**. After prompt → context → harness, the fourth discipline emerging in 2026 is **engineering the agent's iteration loop itself**: the goal, available tools, context management, **termination logic**, and error handling that keep an agent reliable across hundreds of steps and multiple sessions. Claude Code's `/goal` (give a verifiable completion condition and the agent loops until it is met) is exactly this; [Stage 5.6 Dynamic Workflows](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md) is the agent writing its own loop script. Lineage: ReAct (2022) → AutoGPT (2023) → /goal (2026).

**Plain-language difference**:
- **Prompt** = design a good way of asking so the model answers correctly this time
- **Context** = dynamically decide which background, memory, documents, and tool results to include so the model understands the current situation
- **Harness** = connect prompt, context, tools, state, flow control, and error handling into a system that can actually run

**This stage's 3 core questions**:

1. **Multi-agent collaboration** — debate / planner-executor / peer review / handoff / supervisor-worker patterns
2. **Harness Engineering** — agent loop / tool registry (the list of tools an agent can call + interface definitions) / context manager / safety / retry / telemetry / eval / cost (8 core components, detailed below)
3. **Productionization** — eval harness / observability / cost & latency optimization / deployment to a usable environment

**Division of labor with Stage 5** (to avoid confusion):

| Comparison | What's Covered There | What's Covered in This Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 5.5 Subagents** | Claude Code's native subagent mechanism (markdown-based, no coding) | General multi-agent frameworks (autogen / crewAI / langgraph, vendor-agnostic) |
| **Stage 5.7 Claude Code source** | Claude Code source dissection (reference implementation case study) | General harness engineering principles (not tied to a specific vendor) |

### ⚠ But do you really need multi-agent?

**Multi-agent is not the default; it is a design you use only when the task truly needs it.** In most scenarios, you should first try a simple workflow or a single agent; **only when the task is naturally decomposable, needs parallel exploration, a single context is not enough, or explicit role separation is needed, is multi-agent worth introducing**. Forcing it brings **3-10× token cost, difficult debugging, and severe context fragmentation (context gets split across multiple agents, and no one sees the whole picture)**.

> 📌 **The decision framework's canonical home is Stage 4**: the full Anthropic / Cognition stance comparison + the 4 "should you go multi-agent" signals + each signal's corresponding pattern live in [Stage 4 §When do you really need multi-agent](04-agent-frameworks.en.md#when-do-you-really-need-multi-agent-dont-force-it) (design-phase decision). This section is only the last sanity check before production — **none of the 4 signals present?** → a single agent + good prompts + tool use is enough; don't force multi-agent. **The harness engineering part of this stage (8 components / eval / observability) still applies even if you end up using a single agent**—so this stage is still required reading even if you decide against multi-agent.

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Design multi-agent orchestration patterns (debate, planner-executor, peer review)
- Build an evaluation harness for your agent
- Add observability (tracing, logging, cost tracking)
- Use the Anthropic SDK / OpenAI SDK for production deployment (advanced features: streaming, prompt caching, batching)
- Deploy an agent to production (Docker, serverless, monitoring)

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already have:
- Completed Stage 4 (used at least one agent framework to run a multi-agent demo)
- Completed Stage 5 (understand the roles of MCP / Skills / Plugins / Subagents, and have dissected a harness internally in 5.7)
- Completed Stage 6 (know basic RAG, can explain the differences between memory patterns)
- Basic familiarity with Docker / git / CI (will be used in production deployment)

If not, go back and complete the previous stages. This stage is about "combining everything you've learned → running in production," and any missing piece will be a blocker.

## 🏗 Harness Engineering — Engineering Design for a Production Agent Runtime ⭐ Core Concept of This Stage

### Positioning: The execution and control layer around the model

To turn an LLM into a usable agent, you usually run into three layers of engineering problems. These three layers correspond to different engineering positions, not simply "one call" versus "many calls."

> 💡 **Simon Willison 2025**: "coding agent = LLM + harness"; harness = all the code **that is not the model itself**.
>
> 💡 **OpenAI also uses the term "Harness Engineering" in 2026** (see the [OpenAI Harness Engineering article](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering), published 2026-02).

| Layer | What you are engineering | Where to learn it |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Prompt Engineering** | The **string** sent into the LLM (system prompt / few-shot / format) | [Stage 2](02-prompt-engineering.md) |
| **2. Context Engineering** | The **information** placed inside the window (RAG / memory / tool defs / history assembly) | [Stage 6](06-memory-rag.md) |
| **3. Harness Engineering**<br>(**This section**) | The **execution and control layer around the model** (loop / retry / sandbox / observability / deployment) | This stage |

**How do you tell which layer you are working on? Ask**:

1. Am I changing the **string itself**? → Prompt engineering
2. Am I changing the **information put into the window**? → Context engineering
3. Am I changing the **surrounding program that calls the model**? → Harness engineering

→ The three layers are **orthogonal**: a one-call RAG app is still doing context engineering (the key is how the window is assembled); a 50-call chatbot with no retrieval is still only doing prompt engineering.

### The 8 Core Components of a Harness

**Harness Engineering (agent runtime design) = connecting the LLM, tools, memory, state, workflow control, error handling, eval, observability, and deployment into an executable, observable, maintainable agent system.**

→ Everything that is **not part of the model weights**, and is not just the prompt string itself, falls under harness. A deployable agent runtime includes these 8 core components (the first 6 are built into the runtime, the 7th, eval, is a plug-in tool, and the 8th, cost / latency, is a cross-cutting concern):

| Component | What it Does | Corresponding Exercise in this Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent loop** | The "LLM → tool → result → LLM" loop, stably handling multiple turns | Exercise 1 Multi-agent debate |
| **Tool registry** | Dynamic tool dispatch, permission gates, sandboxing | (Present in every framework / SDK) |
| **Context manager** | Message history management, context window control, auto-compaction | Stage 6 + This stage's Exercise 4 SDK |
| **Safety layer** | Permission prompts, sandboxed execution, interception of destructive ops | (Built into Claude Code, customizable in SDKs) |
| **Retry / recovery** | How to handle tool failure (exception vs. the LLM reflecting on the error itself) | Exercise 4 SDK Advanced |
| **Telemetry / Observability** | Metrics, logging, token counting, trace export | **Exercise 3 Observability** |
| **Eval harness** | Regression testing, quality gates, A/B testing | **Exercise 2 Eval** |
| **Cost / Latency optimization** ⭐ Required for 2024-2026 | Prompt caching, model routing, thinking budget, batching, semantic cache | **Exercise 6 Cost optimization** (New) |

**Framework vs. Harness: key difference**:
- **Framework** ([Stage 4](04-agent-frameworks.md)) defines the **API** — what the interface you call looks like
- **Harness** (this section) defines the **runtime** — how it runs, how it recovers, and how it is observed

### Reference Implementations

Want to see what a harness running in production looks like? Two references:

- **The entire Claude Code runtime** — is a reference harness implementation. **For a source-reading exercise, see [Stage 5.7](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#57--dissecting-claude-code-source-reference-harness-implementation--a-must-read-for-track-b)** (clone `claude-agent-sdk-python` and dissect the main loop + where the first 6 runtime components from the table above live; the 7th, Eval harness, is a plugin, and the 8th, Cost / Latency, is cross-cutting, see the deep-dive below)
- **`anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python`** source — the specific repo used in the exercise above

→ The remaining 6 exercises in this stage (multi-agent / eval / observability / SDK / deploy / cost) each cover one facet of the harness. Completing the full stage = assembling a complete mental model of harness engineering.

### Deep dive into the 8th core component — Cost / Latency Optimization (Required for 2024-2026 Productionization)

When a production agent runs long enough, **cost and latency will eat up most of your budget and user experience**. From 2024-2026, frontier models have treated this as a first-class API feature—**knowing how to use it = saving 50-90% on cost / latency**.

| Technique | How it Saves | 2026 Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt caching** | Recurring prefixes (system prompt, long context) are billed once, subsequent cache hits get a ~90% discount | Fully supported by Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini, automatic or manual tagging |
| **Model routing / cascade** | Simple queries → smaller model, difficult queries → frontier model | Built into [RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM) / [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for production |
| **Thinking budget** | Controllable thinking token limit for reasoning models, trading off latency / quality | Claude / Gemini API parameter, high by default in o-series |
| **Speculative decoding** | A smaller model predicts N tokens, a larger model validates them at once, ×2-3 speedup for a single model | Built into vLLM / TGI, automatic at the inference layer |
| **Batching** | Processing multiple queries in parallel for higher GPU utilization | vLLM, production inference layer |
| **Semantic caching** | Sharing answers for similar queries (not just exact matches) | Built into [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache) / Helicone |

**How Track A can use this** (for those using CLI agents):
- Set up prompt caching in Claude Code / Cursor to save 50-90% on daily session costs
- Use [RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM) / [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to dynamically switch models (simple questions use Haiku / Flash, difficult ones use Opus / Pro)
- Use the `thinking_budget` parameter in the Claude API to control the token limit for reasoning models

**How Track B can build this** (for those writing their own agents):
- Build a custom cascade router that maps query embeddings → classifier → model
- Monitor token cost within the agent loop and automatically downgrade if the budget is exceeded
- Integrate a semantic cache layer in the deployed environment
- Observability platforms like [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) / [langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) already have these features built in, so you do not have to write them yourself

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises (Basic Illustrative Exercises)

### Exercise 1: Multi-Agent Debate
Have two agents debate a topic (e.g., "Should we use Python or Rust for the backend?"), with a third agent acting as a referee. Observe the patterns of convergence or divergence in the debate.

### Exercise 2: Eval
Write an eval for your previous agent, run it N times, and measure the success rate. Replace the habit of "I'll just take a look" with a quantitative approach.

### Exercise 3: Observability
Connect LangSmith, Helicone, or weave to an agent and view the full trace. Understand that "debugging an agent without observability = a black box".

### Exercise 4: Advanced SDK
Use streaming + prompt caching + tool use in a single call. See how the costs come down.

### Exercise 5: Deploy
Package an agent into Docker and deploy it to the cloud (any provider will do). Learn to turn a prototype into something that can be run by others.

### Exercise 6: Cost Optimization (New) ⭐
Measure the token cost of any of your previous exercise agents, then add prompt caching and measure again. Observe the relationship between cache hit rate and cost reduction. **Bonus**: Connect to [RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and implement cascade routing (simple queries → Haiku / difficult queries → Opus), and measure the average cost.

## 📊 Agent Benchmark Landscape: How to read it, not just the leaderboard + ⚠ Reward-Hacking Warning

Before choosing a model or building an agent, you'll want to look at benchmark numbers—but in **April 2026, UC Berkeley discovered that all 8 major agent benchmarks can be reward-hacked to ~100%**. Below is the 2026 leaderboard status + how to read it without getting misled.

### Mainstream Agent Benchmark SOTA as of 2026-05

| Benchmark | Domain | 2026-05 SOTA | Leading Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**SWE-bench Verified**](https://www.swebench.com/) | Software Engineering / code agent | **88.6%** | Claude Opus 4.8 |
| [**Terminal-Bench**](https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench) | terminal tasks | Leading | Claude Opus 4.8 |
| **GAIA** | general assistant | **74.6%** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Princeton HAL) |
| [**WebArena**](https://github.com/web-arena-x/webarena) | web navigation | **68.7%** | Claude Mythos Preview |
| [**OSWorld**](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld) | OS-level desktop control | **76.26%** (SOTA, superhuman vs 72.36% human baseline) | OpenAI CUA 38%, most frontier models still under 50% |
| [**τ-bench**](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau-bench) | multi-turn dialogue with tool use | (Harder to hack) | Anthropic / OpenAI leading |
| **RE-bench** | research engineering | (Harder to hack, close to human baseline) | Frontier models |

> **Mythos-class tier (2026-06-09, access suspended 2026-06-12)**: [**Claude Fable 5**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5) (`claude-fable-5`, Mythos-class, positioned above the Opus class) briefly shipped as the publicly available highest-capability Claude tier alongside its sibling Claude Mythos 5 (`claude-mythos-5`, some safeguards lifted, limited to approved customers). ⚠️ **On 2026-06-12 a US export-control directive suspended all access to both ([status](https://status.claude.com/) · [statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access)); they are currently unavailable with no restoration timeline.** The numbers above stay attributed to their original models; Fable 5's official benchmark numbers were never published, so it is not listed. **Opus 4.8 remains the Opus-class flagship and the current top usable tier.**

### ⚠ Berkeley 2026-04 Reward-Hacking Warning

[**UC Berkeley RDI Report 2026-04-12**](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/blog/trustworthy-benchmarks-cont/): An automated scanning agent systematically audited **8 major benchmarks** (SWE-bench / WebArena / OSWorld / GAIA / Terminal-Bench / FieldWorkArena / CAR-bench, etc.) and found that **every single one could be reward-hacked to nearly 100% without the agent actually solving a single task**.

This means that for numbers on the leaderboard like "Claude 87.6% / GPT 85.0%", some X% of that might be hacked, not from genuinely solving the task.

### How to Read Benchmarks Without Being Misled

| Approach | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Only look at the leaderboard top | ❌ All 8 above have been proven hackable |
| Look at task-level success rate breakdown | ✅ Most hacks are concentrated in a few tasks |
| Run your own hold-out test set | ✅✅ The most reliable method, a must for production agents |
| Check the trajectory / log to see if the task was really solved | ✅ Distinguishes reward hacking from a genuine solve |
| Look at multiple benchmarks + your own use case | ✅ Don't rely on a single metric |

**Which benchmarks are harder to hack (as of 2026-05)**:
- **τ-bench** — Multi-turn dialogue + tool use, denser reward function
- **RE-bench** — Real-world research engineering tasks
- **Your own production eval set** ⭐ Always the most reliable

> 💡 **The discipline of production agent eval**:
> - Don't take external benchmark numbers as ground truth; they tell you the "upper limit," not "real-world performance."
> - Your own eval set (internal hold-out test) is the basis for go-live decisions.
> - Every time a model is upgraded → run it against your internal eval set for validation, don't just look at the vendor's published benchmark improvements.
> - Connect to [langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) / [promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) to automate eval and run it with every deployment.

> 📊 **For observability, learn one portable standard + two eval ideas**: (1) **OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions** (`gen_ai.*`): langfuse / Arize Phoenix / Helicone all emit OTel-compatible spans, so learning this layer keeps you from being locked to one tool; the OTel-native [Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) (★10k) is worth a look. (2) **pass^k**: the probability of solving the same task k times in a row (reliability, not a single pass), measured by [τ²-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench). (3) Multi-agent failures have a ready vocabulary: **MAST** ([arXiv 2503.13657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657), 14 failure modes in 3 categories).

> 🌳 For **Claude's native subagent mechanism** (multi-agent without a framework), see [Stage 5.5](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature). This stage focuses on frameworks / production; Stage 5.5 focuses on markdown-based subagent orchestration.

## ✅ Self-Check After Stage 7

Can you:
- [ ] Design a multi-agent system and clearly explain its collaboration protocol?
- [ ] Run an automated eval pipeline in CI?
- [ ] Connect observability (tracing) to a production agent?
- [ ] Measure the cost difference before and after implementing prompt caching on a real workload?
- [ ] Deploy an agent to the cloud (any provider)?

If you can do all of these → first go to [**Stage 7.5 — Advanced Agentic Concepts Map**](07.5-advanced-agentic-concepts.md) (1 week, no coding — build a frontier concept map and locate which advanced concepts the industry is still debating), then proceed to [**Stage 8 — Agent Interfaces**](08-agent-interfaces.md) (**a shared hub for both tracks**) to learn how agents interact with the non-API world (Computer Use / Browser Use / Sandbox). Or, pick a [specialized branch](../README.en.md#-learning-map-two-tracks), or come back and contribute to this repo.

## 💡 What's Next

You now have the foundational skills. For the next 6-12 months, you should focus on:
1. **Picking one production system** and taking it from prototype to production.
2. **Contributing upstream** (LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP servers, Anthropic cookbook).
3. **Reading papers**—agent research is moving fast.
4. **Making something tangible**—open-source a real tool, stop just writing tutorials.

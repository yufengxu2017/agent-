You've built a ReAct agent from scratch (Stage 3). Now, let's see what a framework actually does for you. **Pick one to learn deeply**, and just skim the others to know when to switch.

## 📌 Learning Objectives

After completing this stage, you will be able to:
- Compare 5 major agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Smolagents, OpenAI Agents SDK)
- Select the right framework for a given task
- Build the same agent using two different frameworks to experience the differences firsthand
- Recognize when to ditch the framework and write your own code

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should have already:
- Completed all 5 hello-X projects from Stage 3
- Written a ReAct agent from scratch (Exercise 3)
- Become comfortable with async Python (frameworks rely heavily on it)

## 🤔 What is a multi-agent framework?

### Two Dimensions to Clarify First (Workflow vs. Agent / Single vs. Multi)

To understand multi-agent frameworks, a useful clarification is to treat **workflow vs. agent** and **single vs. multi LLM** as two orthogonal dimensions. The core distinction in Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" is between a workflow (fixed code path) and an agent (LLM autonomously decides the next step). Let's stack this with single/multi to see the four quadrants:

| | **Workflow**<br>(Your pre-written code path) | **Agent**<br>(LLM dynamically decides the next step) |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single LLM** | Linear pipeline, no branching logic | One LLM + ReAct loop, plans and adapts on its own<br>(**This is what you built in Stage 3**) |
| **Multi LLM** | Pre-defined routing (e.g., "sales questions → agent A, tech questions → agent B") | 2+ agents handing off to each other, with an orchestrator dynamically assigning tasks<br>(**The topic of this stage**) |

**Why this distinction is useful**: Most production scenarios fall into the "single agent workflow" + "single agent" quadrants. Most tasks simply don't require multi-agent setups. **The quadrant that truly needs a multi-agent framework is the bottom right**—high LLM autonomy + multi-role collaboration. In practice, the boundaries between these quadrants can be blurry (LangGraph's conditional edges can be seen as both workflow routing and dynamic agent decision-making). Don't treat this matrix as a mutually exclusive classification.

→ All later discussion in this stage assumes you already know: **a multi-agent framework mainly handles the coordination, handoff, state management, and repetitive scaffolding code between multiple agents, so you don't have to write the whole collaboration flow from scratch** (the orchestration boilerplate in the lower-right quadrant).

### Single-agent vs. multi-agent — A comparison table to clarify the differences

| Dimension | **Single-agent** (You built this in Stage 3) | **Multi-agent system** |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture** | One LLM + ReAct loop + several tools | 2+ LLMs, each with a role (researcher / writer / critic...), coordinated by an orchestrator |
| **Decision Making**| The same LLM thinks from start to finish | Role-based decomposition + handoff, different LLM instances see different perspectives |
| **State Management**| Linear message history | Shared state / message passing / checkpoints |
| **Suitable For** | Linear logic, < 20-30 tools, single objective | Decomposable tasks, need for perspective diversity, long workflows, parallelization |
| **Debug Cost** | Low (a single loop is easy to trace) | High (cross-agent interaction, error propagation is hard to pinpoint) |
| **Token Cost** | 1x | Typically **3-10x** (each sub-agent has its own prompt + thinking + tool calls) |
| **Latency** | Low | High (unless sub-agents run in parallel) |

### When do you **really** need multi-agent? (Don't force it)

**Multi-agent is not the default; it's a last resort.** **Both Anthropic and Cognition, two frontier labs, explicitly stated in 2024-2025 that 90% of use cases should not use multi-agent setups.** Forcing it results in **3-10× token costs, painful debugging, and severe context fragmentation.**

| Stance | Source | Core Argument |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anthropic** | [Building Effective Agents (2024)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), [How we built our multi-agent research system (2025)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system) | Most scenarios are fine with a simple workflow + single agent; multi-agent is only truly helpful for "**research-style / parallel exploration**" tasks. |
| **Cognition** | [Don't Build Multi-Agents (2025)](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents) | Multi-agent setups suffer from severe context fragmentation and painful shared state maintenance; exhaust single-agent + long-context options first. |

You typically need multi-agent when one of these four signals appears:

| Signal | Description | Corresponding Pattern |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Natural Task Decomposition** | A large task has clear sub-steps that can be completed step-by-step. | Sequential / Planner-Executor |
| **2. Token Explosion** | A single agent's prompt can't fit all tool descriptions/context. | Supervisor-Worker (offloads to sub-agents) |
| **3. Role Conflict** | Having the same LLM act as both writer and critic leads to self-justification. | Debate / Peer review |
| **4. Parallel Acceleration**| Running 3 research sub-tasks concurrently reduces wall-clock time to 1/3. | Parallel / Map-Reduce variant |

**None of these four signals present?** → A single agent + a good prompt + tool use is enough. **Forcing a multi-agent setup will cost you 3-10x in tokens, be a pain to debug, and won't necessarily be more accurate.**

> 💡 **Further Reading**: [Stage 7 But do you really need multi-agent?](07-multi-agent-production.en.md#-but-do-you-really-need-multi-agent) will revisit this decision from a production perspective. This section covers the design-phase decision; that one is the final check before deployment.

### Classic Multi-agent Patterns (ordered by complexity)

> 📝 **How this differs from Stage 3 Classic Paradigms**: [The 4 paradigms in Stage 3](03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md#classic-agent-paradigms-thinking-patterns) (CoT / ReAct / Reflection / Planning) describe **how a single agent thinks internally**. The 5 patterns in this section describe **how multiple agents collaborate**—two orthogonal layers.

| Pattern | Complexity | What it looks like | Classic Scenarios | Representative Framework / Paper |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Routing / Handoff** | ⭐ | 1:1 handoff between agents, no central orchestrator | Customer support routing, context switching | [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) |
| **2. Sequential**<br>(Planner → Executor) | ⭐⭐ | Planner creates multi-step plan + executor carries it out | Multi-step automation, code generation | LangGraph, [ChatDev paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924) |
| **3. Parallel**<br>(Parallel Acceleration) | ⭐⭐⭐ | N agents run concurrently, results are aggregated | Research / map-reduce tasks, 1/N wall-clock time | LangGraph parallel branches, CrewAI parallel tasks. **Pitfalls**: async coordination, partial failure, state merge consistency. |
| **4. Supervisor-Worker**<br>(hub-spoke) | ⭐⭐⭐ | 1 supervisor + N workers, supervisor assigns + integrates | Task decomposition, report integration | LangGraph, AutoGen GroupChat |
| **5. Debate / Society**<br>(Multi-perspective convergence) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 2+ agents critique each other or role-play | Research, judgment tasks, social simulation | AutoGen GroupChat, [CAMEL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760), [Generative Agents paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) |

### Claude Code subagent — An alternative orchestration path

> **This section is on a different level than the 5 patterns above**: The 5 patterns are design choices that can be implemented with or without a framework. The **Claude Code subagent** introduced here is another execution model (built-in runtime orchestration, no framework code). After reading about the 5 patterns, this section shows you "there's a second path for multi-agent."

**Frameworks aren't the only way to do multi-agent.** Anthropic's own Claude Code offers another layer of abstraction: the [subagent](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature). You create a subagent by writing a `.claude/agents/<name>.md` file—**no framework required**.

The fundamental difference from the framework path (in one line): the **framework path** is cross-LLM-provider, written as Python orchestration code, with full checkpointing / audit trail; **Claude Code subagent** runs only inside the Claude Code runtime, written as markdown not code, with built-in context isolation.

> 📌 **The full dimension-by-dimension comparison table (startup / runtime / context isolation / provider lock-in / learning curve) lives canonically at [Stage 5.5](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature)** — this stage only needs you to know "there's a second, Claude-Code-native path"; see 5.5 for the per-item implementation differences.

**When to choose subagents over a framework**:
- You're already using Claude Code for your daily work.
- The task context is large and would consume the entire main session window (e.g., reading a whole codebase).
- You want to run multiple subagents in parallel (research / write / critic) to save wall-clock time.
- You don't need cross-provider migration.

For detailed implementation and hands-on exercises, see [Stage 5.5](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md#55--subagents-claude-codes-native-multi-agent-mechanism--2025-new-feature) (**it's recommended to complete Stage 5.1 on Claude Code basics before tackling 5.5**—subagents are an advanced feature of the ecosystem and require familiarity with the basics).

### What Frameworks Do

Frameworks abstract away the orchestration boilerplate for the 5 patterns above (roles, handoffs, state, retries, checkpoints, HITL pauses), letting you focus on writing role definitions and task descriptions. In short: **a framework is scaffolding for multi-agent systems, not a necessity**. For simple scenarios, you could write your own solution with a dictionary and a for loop (which is exactly what you'll do in Stage 7, Exercise 1).

## 🛠 Advanced Tool Patterns (What frameworks handle for you) ⭐ Must-read for Track B

Stage 3 taught you to write single-tool / multi-tool selection (by hand-writing `if/elif/else` routing). Frameworks abstract this layer away and add three more advanced tool patterns. **These three patterns need a framework's abstraction layer to be written cleanly; trying to hand-write them like in Stage 3 would be a mess:**

| Pattern | What problem it solves | Representative Implementation |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic tool selection**| When you have >30 tools, `tools=[...]` is too large for the prompt (context window issues, poor selection). | [LlamaIndex tool router](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/) — Embedding-based routing: first, a semantic search finds the top-K tools, and only those K are put into the prompt. |
| **Tool composition / chaining** | Chaining tool A's output to tool B's input without LLM narrative in between (saves tokens + latency). | LangGraph `state graph` directly connecting nodes, CrewAI `sequential tasks`, Pydantic AI's type-safe pipeline. |
| **Tool-augmented retrieval**| The tool itself is a RAG search → returns results → the agent reasons on the results. | A combination of the Stage 6 Exercise 4 RAG pipeline and Stage 3 Exercise 2 multi-tool selection (LangGraph wraps the retriever as a tool node). |

**📚 In-depth Resources**:
- [**Anthropic — Tool Use best practices**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview) — The official tool design guide.
- [**LlamaIndex — Tool Router pattern**](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/) — The canonical reference for dynamic selection.
- [**LangGraph — Tool Node**](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — How to write a composition graph.

> 💡 **For Track B after this section**: You should be able to explain the differences between implementing the "same task" via (a) hand-writing it in Stage 3, (b) using a framework in this stage, and (c) using a Claude subagent in Stage 5.5. This is a core question for Track B's "knows how to design agents" path.

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise 1: Same agent, two frameworks
Build the same simple agent (search + summarize) using these two frameworks:
- LangGraph
- CrewAI
Compare the lines of code, the debugging experience, and where each framework hides its complexity.

### Exercise 2: Multi-agent role assignment
Use CrewAI to build a demo with 2-3 agents, each with a different role, collaborating on a single task. (This is CrewAI's strong suit.)

### Exercise 3: Graph-based workflow
Use LangGraph to build a workflow with branching logic and a human-in-the-loop checkpoint. (This is LangGraph's strong suit.)

### Exercise 4: CodeAct vs. JSON tool
Use Smolagents to build an agent that writes Python code as its action (the CodeAct pattern). Compare this with the JSON tool-calling approach from Exercise 1. Ask the same question and see how each approach solves it.

### Exercise 5: Type-safe agent
Use Pydantic AI to build an agent that returns structured output (e.g., for a given question, it returns `{ "answer": str, "confidence": float, "sources": [str] }`). See how Pydantic's schema validation prevents the agent from being lazy or hallucinating the structure.

> 💡 **Recommended reading path**: Pick **1 for production deployment** (LangGraph) + **1 for rapid prototyping** (CrewAI) framework to learn deeply → Do exercises 1-3 → Skim the READMEs of the others to know they exist. The **3 specialized paths** (CodeAct / typed / memory-first) are only rivals in specific scenarios; you don't need to touch them otherwise.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Moving to Stage 5

Can you:
- [ ] Build the same agent using both LangGraph and CrewAI?
- [ ] Choose the right framework for a task (production vs. prototype)?
- [ ] Explain the difference between LangGraph's checkpointing and CrewAI's task delegation?
- [ ] See when CodeAct (Smolagents) is better than JSON-tool?
- [ ] Judge when to ditch a framework and use the raw API directly?

If yes → Proceed to [Stage 5 — The Claude Code Ecosystem](05-claude-code-ecosystem.en.md).

## 💡 Strategic Tips + Potential Pitfalls

Don't try to learn all of these. Pick **one for production deployment (LangGraph)** and **one for rapid prototyping (CrewAI)** to learn in depth. For the others, just skim their READMEs to know they exist as options.

**A heads-up on Memory** (you might encounter this while learning, no need to read ahead): Some framework features use memory concepts—LangGraph's checkpointing (state persistence), CrewAI agents passing task results to each other (lightweight memory). These are covered in full in [Stage 6 — Memory & RAG](06-memory-rag.en.md). If you get stuck on a framework feature in this stage, check that section, but **you don't need to read it all before continuing this stage**.

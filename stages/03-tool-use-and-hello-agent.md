# Stage 3 — Tool Use & Hello Agent ⭐

⏱ **Time estimate**: 2-3 weeks (~10-20 hours)

This is the most important stage. **You don't understand agents until you've built one.** No skipping the hello-X demos.

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Explain why LLMs need tools (they're not omniscient and can't do anything outside text)
- Define a tool schema and let an LLM call it
- Build a single-step ReAct agent from scratch (no framework)
- Build a multi-step ReAct agent that decides when to stop
- Recognize when a problem needs tool use vs. plain prompting

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Have working Claude / OpenAI / Gemini API access (Stage 1)
- Be comfortable with prompt engineering basics (Stage 2)
- Be able to write a Python function that takes JSON input and returns JSON

## 📚 Required Reading

1. [**Anthropic — Tool Use**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) — official guide
2. [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) — Yao et al. 2022, the foundational paper. Read at least the abstract and Section 3.
3. [**OpenAI — Function Calling**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) — function-calling format reference
4. [**Build an agent from scratch**](https://shafiqulai.github.io/blogs/blog_3.html) — narrative walkthrough

## 🛠 Hello-X Projects (5 must-run demos)

### Hello-1: Function Calling (single tool, single call)
Give Claude one tool (a fake weather API) and one question ("Is it raining in Taipei?"). Watch Claude call the tool, get the result, and answer.

### Hello-2: Multi-Tool Selection
Give Claude three tools (search, calculator, calendar) and a task. Watch Claude select the right tool. Notice when Claude makes the wrong choice.

### Hello-3: ReAct from Scratch (no framework)
Implement the Thought → Action → Observation loop in 50-80 lines of Python. No LangChain, no LangGraph. Just `while not done: thought; action; observation; ...`.

### Hello-4: Multi-Step Reasoning Task
A task that requires 3-5 tool calls in sequence. E.g., "Find the population of Taipei, then divide by the population of New York, and convert the ratio to percent." Each step uses a different tool.

### Hello-5: Error Handling
Make a tool fail (network error, invalid input). Watch how the agent recovers (or doesn't). Add retry logic.

| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: Build agents with local LLMs and ZERO frameworks. ReAct, function calling, memory — all from scratch. Designed to demystify what frameworks hide.

**Best for**: Hello-3 (ReAct from scratch). This is the cleanest "no-framework" reference.

**Notes**: Uses local Ollama, so works without API costs. Read the README carefully — the pedagogical structure is excellent.

**What it teaches**: Minimal self-evolving agent framework — core ~3K lines of code, agent grows skill tree from a seed. Supports Claude / Gemini / Kimi / MiniMax. Active development.

**Best for**: Hello-3 / Hello-4 alternative for readers who want a more "minimal but full" framework reference. Good middle ground between mattambrogi's toy and full LangGraph.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 4

Can you:
- [ ] Define a tool schema (name + description + JSON schema input/output)
- [ ] Implement ReAct loop in <100 lines of Python without any framework
- [ ] Explain why an agent needs an "I'm done" exit condition
- [ ] Compare CodeAct (code as action) vs JSON-tool approach
- [ ] Identify when a problem doesn't need an agent

If yes → proceed to [Stage 4 — Agent Frameworks](04-agent-frameworks.md).

If no → run Hello-3 again. Don't skip it. The frameworks in Stage 4 will mystify you if you don't understand what they're abstracting.

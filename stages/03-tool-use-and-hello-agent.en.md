# Stage 3 — Tool Use & Agent Intro ⭐

> [繁體中文](./03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.md) | [简体中文](./03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 2-3 weeks (~10-20 hours)

> 💡 Term-dense stage (agent / tool use / function calling / ReAct / structured output / …) → see [`resources/glossary.en.md` §2](../resources/glossary.en.md#2-agents--tool-use).
> 🗺️ **Before committing to Track A (CLI Power User) or Track B (Agent Builder)**, read [`resources/agent-paradigms.en.md`](../resources/agent-paradigms.en.md) — the 5-paradigm map of the agent landscape that helps you pick a track.

This is the most important stage. **You don't understand agents until you've built one.** No skipping the hello-X demos.

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Explain why LLMs need tools (they're not omniscient and can't do anything outside text)
- Define a tool schema and let an LLM call it
- Build a single-step ReAct agent from scratch (no framework)
- Build a multi-step ReAct agent that decides when to stop
- Recognize when a problem needs tool use vs. plain prompting

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Have working Claude / OpenAI / Gemini API access (Stage 1)
- Be comfortable with prompt engineering basics (Stage 2)
- Be able to write a Python function that takes JSON input and returns JSON

## 📚 Required Reading

2. [**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) — Yao et al. 2022, the foundational paper. Read at least the abstract and Section 3.
3. [**OpenAI — Function Calling**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) — function-calling format reference
4. [**Build an agent from scratch**](https://shafiqulai.github.io/blogs/blog_3.html) — narrative walkthrough

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises (5 to do)

> 🦙 **This stage defaults to Ollama qwen2.5:3b** (cost-driven; reliable tool-use support). Once you enter Stage 3 — tool calling and the ReAct loop — `gemma3n:e4b` no longer suffices; switch to `qwen2.5:3b` (1.9 GB; install with `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`). Every exercise has Path A (Ollama, default) + Path B (Anthropic, optional — when you want to see cloud-quality tool use).

### Exercise 1: Function Calling (single tool, single call)
Give Claude one tool (a fake weather API) and one question ("Is it raining in Taipei?"). Watch Claude call the tool, get the result, and answer.

<details>
<summary>📋 <b>Starter code</b> (copy to <code>practice_1.py</code> and run <code>python practice_1.py</code>)</summary>

```python
# Requires: pip install anthropic
# Env: export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Step 1: Define tool schema — write descriptions the LLM can read at a glance.
weather_tool = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Look up the current weather (sunny/rainy/cloudy) for a city. Returns a short string.",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "city": {"type": "string", "description": "City name (e.g. 'Taipei')"},
        },
        "required": ["city"],
    },
}

# Step 2: Ask the question; let Claude decide whether to call the tool.
resp = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-haiku-4-5",  # Use haiku to save money; switch to claude-sonnet-4-5 for smarter answers.
    max_tokens=512,
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Is it raining in Taipei right now?"}],
)

# === Self-check ===
print("stop_reason:", resp.stop_reason)
for block in resp.content:
    print(block)

assert resp.stop_reason == "tool_use", "Expected the LLM to call a tool (not answer directly)."
tool_calls = [b for b in resp.content if b.type == "tool_use"]
assert len(tool_calls) >= 1, "Expected at least one tool_use block."
assert tool_calls[0].name == "get_weather", f"Expected get_weather, got {tool_calls[0].name}."
assert tool_calls[0].input.get("city"), "Expected the city argument to be filled in."
print("✅ Exercise 1 passed — Claude picked get_weather with a city argument.")
```

**Expected output** (first 3 lines):
```
stop_reason: tool_use
TextBlock(text='Let me check...', type='text')
ToolUseBlock(id='toolu_...', input={'city': 'Taipei'}, name='get_weather', type='tool_use')
✅ Exercise 1 passed — Claude picked get_weather with a city argument.
```

**No API key handy?** Wrap `client.messages.create(...)` in a `unittest.mock.MagicMock` that returns a canned `tool_use` block; the asserts still work. Full mock pattern: [`examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/test.py`](../examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/test.py).

> 🦙 **Local Ollama for tool use**: pick the `qwen2.5:3b` model (supports OpenAI function-calling format); use the `openai` SDK with `base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1"`; wrap each tool schema in `{"type": "function", "function": {...}}`; read the call back from `r.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.name`. Full Ollama starter: [`examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/starter_ollama.py`](../examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/starter_ollama.py) (pilot — other exercises follow the same pattern).

### Exercise 2: Multi-Tool Selection
Give Claude three tools (search, calculator, calendar) and a task. Watch Claude select the right tool. Notice when Claude makes the wrong choice.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-3/02-multi-tool-selection/`](../examples/stage-3/02-multi-tool-selection/)

### Exercise 3: ReAct from Scratch (no framework)
Implement the Thought → Action → Observation loop in 50-80 lines of Python. No LangChain, no LangGraph. Just `while not done: thought; action; observation; ...`.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/`](../examples/stage-3/03-react-from-scratch/) (includes mock-based test.py so you can validate the logic without spending API credits)

### Exercise 4: Multi-Step Reasoning Task
A task that requires 3-5 tool calls in sequence. E.g., "Find the population of Taipei, then divide by the population of New York, and convert the ratio to percent." Each step uses a different tool.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-3/04-multi-step-reasoning/`](../examples/stage-3/04-multi-step-reasoning/)

### Exercise 5: Error Handling
Make a tool fail (network error, invalid input). Watch how the agent recovers (or doesn't). Add retry logic.

→ **Full runnable version** → [`examples/stage-3/05-error-handling/`](../examples/stage-3/05-error-handling/)

### Exercise 6: Function schema design (fix a bad schema)
**Start with a deliberately bad schema** — vague `description` ("processes data"), all params typed as `string`, no required/optional split, missing `enum` where it should exist. Watch the LLM pick the wrong tool / pass wrong args. Then fix it piece by piece:
- Rewrite `description` so the LLM understands *when* to call this tool (not docstring style)
- Use proper types (number / boolean / enum / array); be explicit about required
- Collapse fuzzy fields with `enum` (e.g. `unit: "celsius" | "fahrenheit"` instead of `unit: string`)
- Make errors recoverable: return `{"error": "...", "retry_hint": "..."}` so the LLM can retry intelligently

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Python / TypeScript |
| Stars | ★ 16k+ |
| License | MIT |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: Anthropic's official hands-on starter kit. Three deployable agent templates: `financial-data-analyst` (data analysis agent), `customer-support-agent`, and `computer-use-demo` (Claude operating a screen).

**Best for**: After Exercise 1/Exercise 2, when you want to see "what does a real application look like" from the canonical source. More polished than community implementations, with proper deployment setup.

**Notes**: Each template is a self-contained sub-folder — pick one and run it. The computer-use demo is especially worth studying as one of the few official examples of a GUI-operating agent.

**What it teaches**: Smol agents (≤1000 LOC). Code-writing agents that execute Python instead of JSON tool calls.

**Best for**: Exercise 5 alternative. Especially good for local LLM experimentation.

**Notes**: HF's stance: agents should be small. Their code-action approach is intellectually distinct from JSON-tool approach. Worth comparing.

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 4

Can you:
- [ ] Define a tool schema (name + description + JSON schema input/output)
- [ ] Implement ReAct loop in <100 lines of Python without any framework
- [ ] Explain why an agent needs an "I'm done" exit condition
- [ ] Compare CodeAct (code as action) vs JSON-tool approach
- [ ] Identify when a problem doesn't need an agent

If yes → proceed to [Stage 4 — Agent Frameworks](04-agent-frameworks.md).

If no → run Exercise 3 again. Don't skip it. The frameworks in Stage 4 will mystify you if you don't understand what they're abstracting.
